<h2>Flugpo</h2>
<br />
<p>Flugpo used tags instead of predefined categories to organize content. This approach means that search is key and so I designed a way to display results in a way that promoted good use of tags as they continued to use the site.</p>

<br />
<p>Just as important as the first search was the second search as you tried to narrow down what you are looking for. This interface was made to easily add and remove search options instead of starting from scratch with a blank search box.</p>

<h3>Region Select Dropdown</h3>
<p>A large part of Flugpo was navigating your region. This dropdown that I designed the interaction as well as coded the javascript was the perfect way to select your local college or bubble up to see classified from an entire state.</p>

<h3>Multi File Select Upload</h3>
<p>When people look for classifieds they want to see pictures. So the upload functionality was extremely important. This feature that I designed and coded the javascript easily let you upload multiple images as well as set one image as the main image to display on search pages.</p>
