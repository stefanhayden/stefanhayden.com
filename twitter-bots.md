Hi. I've written some twitter bots for fun. If you tweet something that trigger a response from on of my bots just tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanhayden">@stefanhayden</a> and I will add you to a list of people for my tweet bots to ignore.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/GermanWordFor">@GermanWordFor</a> - retweets people who use the "What's the German word for" meme. It's mostly a retorical question but feel free to tweet some German words at those in need.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/internethugs">@InternetHugs</a> - Looks for people who are sad or need a hug and tweets them a hug. You can also tweet right at this account to receive some hugs.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Netflix_Suggest">@Netflix_Suggest</a> - Tweeting out all the great Netflix categories. They have over 93,000 of them. As inspired by this <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/">Atlantic article</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ideabot">@IdeaBot</a> - retweets people who have ideas for twitterbots.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/pardonmybot">@PardonMyBot</a> - rewteets people who say "Pardon my French"</li>
</ul>
