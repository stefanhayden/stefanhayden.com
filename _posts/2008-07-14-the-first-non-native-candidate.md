Well it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/us/politics/11mccain.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=us&adxnnlx=1215869280-IlqFxD12/4f2cZPH0hRguw&oref=slogin">seems official to me that McCain is not a natural born citizen</a> and is technically not able to be president. In regards to McCain in particular I certainly think he is qualified to run even if he does not meet the current standard. McCain's lawyers argue that technicality was not ever intended but instead of trusting people to follow the spirit of the law congress did move to fix the problem.

It's these kind of cracks that should let us reevaluate if our standards are correct. I certainly think we could have a much more broadly defined qualification with out much change. That a citizen who identifies with America  far more then any other nationality might be sufficient if extremely hard to test for. For the most part I think the election process is enough the rule out anyone who is not viscerally American.
