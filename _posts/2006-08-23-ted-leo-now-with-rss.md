<p><a href="http://www.tedleo.com/1/">Ted Leo and the Pharmacists</a> have a cool news section of their site that they often update with not only news but commentary as well. Yes that's right they have a make shift blog but with no frills. And that means no RSS feed.</p>
<p>No RSS feed? I'm supposed to visit the web site? forget that! I've gone through the trouble to make an RSS feed for them:</p>
<h2><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TedLeoRss">Ted Leo RSS Feed</a></h2>
