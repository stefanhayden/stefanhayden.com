So let me get this straight... I can bye the Feist album from iTunes for 9.99 with DRM... or I can buy it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Reminder/dp/B000V9D0XY/ref=sr_f3_1/102-8381359-5438521?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1190762429&sr=103-1">Amazon for 8.99 with NO DRM</a>? This is crazy. I love amazon. My dreams have come true.
