<img style="float: right" alt="Harry Potter" title="Harry Potter" src="http://myspace-406.vo.llnwd.net/00282/60/46/282476406_m.gif" />First there was <a href="http://www.myspace.com/harryandthepotters">Harry and the Potters</a>. They really were not that good but very amusing.

<a href="http://www.myspace.com/dracoandthemalfoysusa">Draco and the Malfoys</a> is the real deal. amazing music.

Update: <span class="nametext"><a href="http://www.myspace.com/theremuslupins">The Remus Lupins</a> -- I think Harry Potter has </span><span class="nametext">officially </span><span class="nametext">spawned it's own music industry.</span>

harrypotter, malfoy, draco, dracomalfoys, music?
