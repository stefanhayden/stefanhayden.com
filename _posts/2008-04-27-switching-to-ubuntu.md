at the very least I would like to. Ubuntu 8 is pretty hot and seems to have a lot polish that makes it feel really complete and solid. The fact that I can install it on windows as an app is just amazing.

so far these are the things that are keeping me from switching completely:
<ul class="li">
	<li>Photoshop</li>
	<li>all the music players suck... I still don't love winamp but it does the job the best for me.</li>
	<li>FireFox also still displays ass on linux.</li>
	<li>I wish Wine worked better.</li>
</ul>

<p>But hopefully these things will be able to be fixed in the next couple years and I can make the full jump over.</p>
