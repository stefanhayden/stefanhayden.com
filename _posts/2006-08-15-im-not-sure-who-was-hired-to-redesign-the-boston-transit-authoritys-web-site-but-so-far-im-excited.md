<p>I'm not sure who was hired to redesign the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/">Boston Transit Authority's web site</a> but so far I'm excited. They have a really nice header that animates down from the top to get people to take a survey and if you check the code it all uses css and the DOM. The design is simple and strong and if the header is any look in to how the final site will look I can't wait.
