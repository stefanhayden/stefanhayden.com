Terry Goodkind's <a href="http://www.hollywoodnorthreport.com/article.php?Article=3295">Sword of Truth series will be turned in a miniseries</a>. Each book will be it's own miniseries which if closely follows the books <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite">will never end</a>.

The 10 book series (the last books has yet to come out) has been a large focus on my reading over the past couple of years. What started out as a strong series quickly degraded in to repetitive generic fantasy with way too much political commentary about freewill instead of plot.

If I wasn't already 9 books in I would not bother with the last book. I think around 6 or 7 is when I started to feel disappointed and looking back to book 4 you can see the problems start. The main story arch is the only things that keeps me coming back. If you removed all the cruff you could cram all 10 books in to about 6.

Hopefully if the miniseries is done well it will trim down the books in to what was originally so great about them.
