Welcome to the first step of many in updating this dingy old web site. As I sign up for more and more web services across the internet I slowly lose time I could be devoting to adding content to this site.

This leave me with two options. I could stop using other web services (like <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a>) and save my links here or I can start to combine these services back in to this site and let me update content here while still using outside services.

The first step is changing up <a href="http://del.icio.us/STHayden/stefanblog/">my del.icio.us feed</a> to integrate in to my rss. Now if I update del.icio.us or this blog they will both appear in the rss feed, so subscribe today.

I don't intend to flood you with new content but hopefully I will finally be able to point out really interesting content that I would not have included with the web site previously.

<strong>Update:</strong> <strike>well it was working for a bit and now something broke... look for it in the near future.</strike> OKay that was not as hard as i thought it world be.

<strong>Update 2:</strong> Sorry for making your rss reader go crazy. I'm 100% sure it's all fixed now.
