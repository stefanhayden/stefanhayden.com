I've gotten a lot of satisfaction out of <a href="http://www.trackslife.com/user/STHayden/010706/books">keeping track of the books I've been reading</a>. I only wish I've always had a list of what I have been reading and when. Now I want to take more control of the <a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/what-to-read/">books I intend to read</a>. So far I'm not sure if I like the system I have going but I don't think I'm that far off.
