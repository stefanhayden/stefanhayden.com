<a href="http://commandshift3.com">commandshift3</a> is a hot or not for websites. I've been trying to get Sugarloot to do this for myspace pages but no one ever seemed interested. While the idea might get old fast their about page and after you submit a site shows it has a biting dry sense of humor that I enjoy greatly.
