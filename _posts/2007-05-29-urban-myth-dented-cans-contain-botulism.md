<p>Stop telling me dented soda cans will give me Botulism. It's not going to happen:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the United States an average of 110 cases of botulism are reported each year. Of these, approximately 25% are foodborne, 72% are infant botulism, and 3% are wound botulism. Outbreaks of foodborne botulism involving two or more persons occur during most years and usually are caused by eating contaminated home-canned foods.  -  (Via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism">Wikipedia</a>) </p>

110 cases? 72% infants? That's only like 27 adults. Or 1 out of every 11 million people (approx.)
