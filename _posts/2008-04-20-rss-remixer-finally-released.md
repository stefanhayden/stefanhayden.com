<a href="http://locke61dv.livejournal.com/291350.html">Dev finally revealed</a> to the world the great <a href="http://www.rss-remixer.com">RSS Remixer</a> that he himself had been using for weeks now. It's a really great way to avoid the repetitive need to compile this myself while also avoiding punishing people by putting it all directly in my rss feed.
