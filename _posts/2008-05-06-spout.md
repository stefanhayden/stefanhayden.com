<a href="http://blog.spout.com/2008/05/06/ten-avengers-characters-who-should-be-in-the-movie-but-probably-wont/">Spout seems to have confirmed a lot of my suspicions about continuity in the marvel movies</a> and I could not be any happier. Already there is a rumor about Stark/Iron Man making an appearance in the Hulk Movie.

I wonder what kind of contract these actors are signing as continuity is fun but disapointing if actors have to be switched out in different movies.
