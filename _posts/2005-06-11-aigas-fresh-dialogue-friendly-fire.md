<img src='wp-content/fresh05.jpg' alt='Fresh Dialogue: Friendly Fire' align="left" /><a href="http://www.aigany.org/events/details/?event=05FD">AIGA's Fresh Dialogue: Friendly Fire</a>, which was their last event for the year and is the first AIGA event I have helped run, was a blast. Escorted by another <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu">TCNJer</a> we quick found our selves out of place as all the <a href="http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/">SVA students</a> seemed very well acquainted with the AIGA staff. Every one was very friendly and we ended up talking with some great people.

As an event it was fairly well planned. They had about 20 volunteers for an event that <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~cub">CUB</a> would have only have had about 10. Mark Byron was well in control and used his large volunteer staff to good effect. He was able to cover a lot of bases that CUB would not have bother with like people at alternate entrances directing people to the correct one.

James Victore moderated and he is very colorful character but did not come across as the best moderator. At times he seemed unprepared though this maybe partly due to the odd nature of the talk. <a href="http://www.the62.com/">The 62</a> and the Crye Association (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Crye%20Association&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&sa=N&tab=iw">no site?</a>) were not graphic design companies but more along the lines of industrial designers. I am all for the holistic approach to learning about design but James had a hard time bringing the conversation back to design. There was also little talk between the two groups till them end (at which point I had to go back up to get ready to sell books) about how The 62 kind of hates what the Crye Association does (a lot of military design).

Though it was less then a dialog and more of two sets of speakers talking in turn it was really interesting to see the work that both groups were doing. It nice to just be awear what others are doing with in the same industry as you even if you don't have an interest in doing it your self.

Afterwards a lot of us went down to a very nice bar and hung out with the other volunteers, AIGA professional staff, and the presenters themselves. I'm not really a bar person but I had a lot of fun and talked to some amazing people including Robyn Jordan, one of the AIGA staff, who I got to talk a lot about the AIGA organization and its inner workings.

I had so much fun and really look forward to being involved in more organization up in Boston. Who says graduating from college is a bad thing? Not me.
