The biggest news from a youtube creator since annoying orange got it's own tv show. Meghan Camarena of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Strawburry17">Strawburry17</a> and Joey formerly of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WinterSpringPro">WinterSpringPro</a> and now his personal channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JoeyGraceffa">JoeyGraceffa</a> are going to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-new-teams-for-the-amazing-race-announced-20130123,0,5670590.story">be on The Amazing Race</a>. And what a great team they will be (or were as the show has already been filmed).

While exciting news for the youtube community who hunger for broader recognition and validation no one is surprised that these two have made such a deal. Both Meghan and Joey are growing stars with a lot of energy and know for their hustle and hard work to make ends meet on youtube Increasingly with low CPM ad impressions and views harder to get as youtube redesigns for bigger partners burgeoning stars have to find more and more way to bring in extra money.

What might have attracted The Amazing Race to these two untested stars?

First Joey and Meghan have almost half a million subscribers combined. Of those Meghan gets on average 20-30k views and Joey between 60-100k view. Of those views I would guess they are in the 13-17 age range and mostly female. This demo, while hard to track on Nielsen, would be an attractive audience for the CBS show to bring in. While holding stead at about 10 million viewers The Amazing Race will need to continue to find new audiences to keep their numbers up on a network where many shows are doing well.

Second Joey and Meghan are naturals in front of the camera practicing talking to a camera for years. Few people get this training and few contests have a proven body of work to demonstrate how they will be on the show.

The benefit is not all on Amazing Race's side though. Look for Meghan and Joey to take full advantage of being in front of 10 million viewers weekly. I expect to see some interesting weekly online content and live interaction as the show airs building new viewership for their channels as well as the show's.
