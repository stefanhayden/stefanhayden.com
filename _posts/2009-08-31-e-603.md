So Keri and I were poking around Blip.fm (I love any site that lets me <a href="http://www.last.fm">audioscroble</a>) and we came across <a href="https://www.tornup.net/TORNUP">E-603</a> (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/e603">myspace</a>) and we're totally in love. Defiantly the best mashups I've heard since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Ripper-Explicit/dp/B001EJ4GKQ/stefanhayden-20">night ripper</a>. E-603 works on donations and I totally threw them $5 and you should too.
