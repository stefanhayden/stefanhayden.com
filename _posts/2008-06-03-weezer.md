When I heard the new weezer song I didn't really like it but I thought I might come around. The more I hear it though the more I hate it. Like really hate it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A62PP6/stefanhayden-20">The album is out now and you can preview the songs on amazon</a>. This really has to be not only the worst weezer album but just a horrible attempt at making music. I have some affection for the Green album and Maladroit and some songs on Make Believe are guilty pleasure worthy but this album is just painful to hear and I refuse to own it.
