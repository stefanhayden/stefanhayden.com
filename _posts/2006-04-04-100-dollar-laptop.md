With <a href="http://news.com.com/Negroponte+Slimmer+Linux+needed+for+100+laptop/2100-7346_3-6057456.html?tag=nefd.lede">so many changes</a> in store for the upcoming $100 it must be earlier in production then I thought. Here is a choice excerpt:
<blockquote>Negroponte said one meeting with an unnamed display manufacturer spotlighted the importance of high-volume manufacturing.

"I said, 'We'd like to work with you on the display. We need a small display. It doesn't have perfect color uniformity, it can have pixel or two missing, it doesn't have to be that bright," Negroponte recounted. "The manufacturer said, 'Our strategic plan is to make big displays with perfect color uniformity, zero pixel defects and to make it very bright for the living room.'"

"I said, 'That's too bad, because I need 100 million a year.' They said, 'Well, maybe we can change our strategic plan.' That's the reason you need scale," Negroponte said.</blockquote>
Too funny.
