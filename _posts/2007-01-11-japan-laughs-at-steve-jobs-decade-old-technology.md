It's sad that America is so far behind in technology.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how much we would make fun of a country if they started talking about this great invention called Cable TV that will revolutionize TV in their country.</p>
<p>The worst part is if you look at every way America is behind on technology it's alway because of politics. Cellphones, internet speeds, and music and entertainment industries are all so far behind in America simply because we've enacted so many laws to protect those industries.</p>
<p>Why do we let the government coddle these industries?
