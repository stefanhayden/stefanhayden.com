One of the things that really gets me about racism is when people complain about the the stuff that doesn't matter. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/15/couples-retreat-poster-in_n_358276.html">Here's two version of a poster for "Couples Retreat"</a>. Your supposed to supposed to be offended by the UK version that has edited out the black couple.

Guess what? If you want to be angry at racism then you should be pissed at the US poster as well as the whole movie. I agree with the movie Studio. They edited out the more minor characters and put the more famous people up front. I'm supposed to feel better about the US poster with the tiny black couple in the background? I'm supposed to feel better about a movie industry that does not give leading roles to blacks unless it's a film for blacks?

This is just an instance where people see their own biases and become uncomfortable. I'm not singling this movie out. I've not seen it and I hear it's fairly good. But in an industry where blacks are marginalized don't get pissed if the poster reflects that reality. Instead of adding more black people to posters why not just go see more movies with black people?
