<a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/game/4831.html">This is a really great Final Fantasy Retrospective on GameTrailers</a>. It's only 3 episodes in to a 13 part series. Though I bought the most recent one I stopped playing halfway through. These games seem to not hold my interest if I can only play them a little at the time.
