<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-20-names-marriage_N.htm">More men taking wives' last names</a> and apparently getting lots of shit for it. Not surprisingly only a few states make it easy for a man to change his name through marriage: Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York and North Dakota <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_name#Legal_status_and_criticisms">[1]</a>. California has currently introduced a bill. (via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/03/13069.html">Kottke</a>)
