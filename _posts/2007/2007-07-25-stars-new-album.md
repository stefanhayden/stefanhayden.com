<p><a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Stars-In-Our-Bedroom-After-the-War-MP3-Download/11064613.html" style="float:right; margin-left:10px;"><img src="http://www.emusic.com/img/album/110/646/11064613_155_155.jpeg"></a><a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Stars-In-Our-Bedroom-After-the-War-MP3-Download/11064613.html">The Stars' new album, In Our Bedroom After the War, is up in advance on eMusic</a>. I hope this is not just a marketing ploy and they just put the MP3s when they were done and the rest of the world has to wait simply because the CDs need to be pressed.</p>
<p>I really liked their last album, <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Stars-Set-Yourself-On-Fire-MP3-Download/11030081.html">Set Yourself On Fire</a>, as there was three or four songs that I really feel in love with. You Ex-Lover Is Dead is just amazing and also worked almost as well in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrassi:_The_Next_Generation">Degrassi</a> episode (go canada!) as <a href="http://www.myspace.com/siamusic">Breath Me</a> did in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under">Six Feet Under</a>. Calendar Girl is also amazing.</p>
<p>In Our Bedroom After the War is a solid album but doesn't have any songs that really jump out at me. Over time I'm going to learn to love all the songs but I really love albums that grab me with really amazing singles.</p>
<p>I can't say they got worse cause they sound great and the album is a good purchase for any Stars fan. But they were not as lucky as last album with songs that really grab you.</p>
<p>If you want to get in to the Stars I would not start with this album and instead <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Stars-Set-Yourself-On-Fire-MP3-Download/11030081.html">check out Set Your Self on Fire</a>.
