At best <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html">Knol</a> seems like some kind of About.com type website. As far as I know they currently own the market on crappy single author articles with giant ads on them.

<a href="http://www.google.com/help/knol_screenshot.html">Google's example uses insomnia</a> and <a href="http://insomnia.about.com/">here's About.com's page on insomnia</a>. I mean really what is the difference?
