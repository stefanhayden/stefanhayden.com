<p><a href="http://theguiridispatches.wordpress.com/2007/07/18/a-look-at-spain-for-a-moment/">~1,167 die trying to immigrate to Spain illegally</a>. Spain owns two tiny cities on the coast of northern Morocco, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta">Ceuta</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla">Melilla</a>, which are also popular way for Subsaharans to illegally enter the EU. The EU funded ~$70 million to build some very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta_border_fence">hardcore</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla_border_fence">fences</a>. Which is sad but it's also nice to see America's not the meanest when it comes to immigration.
