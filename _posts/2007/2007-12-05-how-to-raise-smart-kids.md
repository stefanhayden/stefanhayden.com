There seems to be a lot of good articles recently about <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids&amp;print=true">how to raise smart kids</a>. About how telling them they are smart is different them telling them the amount of effort they put in makes them smart. To a point I definitely suffered from this as a kid and I still struggle with it today. It's hard to relearn to just put on foot in front of the other.
