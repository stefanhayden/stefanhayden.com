<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2007/12/podcast-chris-hardwick-of-hard-n-phirm.html#links">Chris Hardwick points out that bowling is not in the Olympics</a>. I know who cares? But he also points out that curling is in the Olympics. Why one and not the other? I thinks this needs to be fixed.
