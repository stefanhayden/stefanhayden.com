Google reader has also released a featured that is almost cool enough for me to like. I like the idea of <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-20ers.html">my reading list being turned in to my blogroll</a>.

I need more option though. I just don't want a list. I want to be able to sort them bye which I read the most. I don't see why instead of a javascript include they can't just put out an API. Sue it's more work but this feature seems like it's for the power users anyway.
