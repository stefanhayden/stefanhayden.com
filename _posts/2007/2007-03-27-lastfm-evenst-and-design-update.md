<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/events/">Last.FM add new events section</a> based on music preferences and updates design yet again! </p>
<p>The frequency of their design changes continues to amaze me. This time they remove the icons in the top menu and mad the words bigger. Many have argued that icons are really not as helpful as the words themselves. </p>
<p>Removing the help menu option seems to have also been a good idea as help really should not be such a large focus of a site.</p>
<p>They also made their logo a lot smaller. This is odd choice but it does seem to fit in to the header's new layout with the white divider.</p>
