<p>We seem to have saved all the endangered animals since <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/03/27/endangered_species/">the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a 117-page draft proposal</a> to “limit the number of species that can be protected and curtail the acres of wildlife habitat to be preserved.” I'm so glad we fixed this problem. Bastards. (via <a href="http://librarianavengers.org/">Librarian Avengers</a>)
