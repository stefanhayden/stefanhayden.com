<a href="http://www.intensedebate.com">Intense Debate seems like a cool new service</a>. You can install it on your site as a commenting system to replace the default system in popular systems like blogger and wordpress. It seems to integrate pretty well with the ability to import and export comments and just a lot of work was put in to not seem like a silo stealing your information.

The functionality seems a little over kill for small site like mine but I do like the benefit of knowing more about who is leaving comments. I can't see my self being an early adopter but if this catches on and tons of people use it I would not be opposed to setting it up.
