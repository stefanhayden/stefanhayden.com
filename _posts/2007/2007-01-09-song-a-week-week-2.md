Song 2: <a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/mp3/The_Salteens-Time_You_Have_Been_Wasting.mp3">Time You Have Been Wasting (MP3)</a>
This will be my first entry in the female lead singer category. And it will not be my last. <a href="http://www.boompa.ca/index.cfm?go=artist.bio&artist=thesalteens">The Salteens</a> also have a male vocalist that helps add alot of texture. I feel that bands that use both a male and female vocalist can do more then other bands can. Not only is this a solid power pop band but they are also straight out of Canada where so mush great music hides with out making it's way in to the USA.
