<a href="http://crimereports.com/">CrimeReports.com</a> can get law enforcement uploading geo-coded data in under and hour (<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/12/03/a-conversation-with-greg-whisenant-about-crimereportscom/">as explained in this Jon Udell podcast</a>). I really hope they get a lot of police departments involved. So far non of NJ or NY is even on the map though it's not surprising.
