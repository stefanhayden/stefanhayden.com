<a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/coscripter/browse/about">CoScripter</a> sounds like a cool extension but if you look at <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/coscripter/browse/scripts?sort=rating">the top scripts</a> they really are not that exciting. No to mention that it completly killed my firefox performance. I can't believe it slowed down so much after installing it.
