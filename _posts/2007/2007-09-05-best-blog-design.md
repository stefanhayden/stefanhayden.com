<p>Sure it's a popularity contest but the competition for <a href="http://www.bloggerschoiceawards.com/categories/29">Best Blog Design</a> at the <a href="http://www.bloggerschoiceawards.com">Blogger's Choice Awards</a> is pretty thin. The Design community needs to jump in and show them who's boss. (<a href="http://www.bloggerschoiceawards.com/blogs/show/27314">vote for me!</a> Ick.. clearly it's using alexa's old cashed image of my site)
