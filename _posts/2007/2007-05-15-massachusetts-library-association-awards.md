<p><a href="http://www.maldenpubliclibrary.org"><img src="/blog/wp-content/maldenpubliclibrary.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"></a> It's always nice when your work is recognized and just recently I was (sort of) recognized for my work on the <a href="http://www.maldenpubliclibrary.com">Malden Public Library</a> website. The site won <a href="http://www.masslib.org/PRAwards07/index.htm">The 18th Biennial Public Relations Awards</a> from the Massachusetts Library Association.</p>
<p>There are still a lot more changes to be made to the site but even with what we have already updated it seems to be making a difference in the community.
