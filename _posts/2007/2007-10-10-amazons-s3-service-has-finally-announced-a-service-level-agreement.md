<a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2007/10/amazon_startups">Amazon's S3 service has finally announced a Service Level Agreement</a>. If they are not up 99.9% of the time they will offer compensation. This is a big hurdle that a lot of companies were waiting for them to jump. Hopefully this will help them get even more traction in the startup world.
