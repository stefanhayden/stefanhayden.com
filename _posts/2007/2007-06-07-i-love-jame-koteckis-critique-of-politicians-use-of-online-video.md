<p><a href="http://jameskotecki.blogspot.com/">I love Jame Kotecki's critique of politicians' use of online video</a>. He's gotten enough fame that he has interviewed several presidential candidates. It's been disappointing he doesn't talk to them more about the internet. I can learn about their politics else where.
