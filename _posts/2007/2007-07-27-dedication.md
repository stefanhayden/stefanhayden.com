<p>I can't tell if this movie looks good or not. I want to like it but something about it really makes me think of <a href="http://foureyedmonsters.com/watch/">Four Eyed Monsters</a>. Something about the editing, music, and story just have that feel to it. If it's ripping them off I'm gonna be a little pissed like I was watching Dark City after I had seen the Matrix (The Matrix ripped them off). I think I fall on the side of excited though just cause Mandy Moore look absolutely stunning in this movie.
