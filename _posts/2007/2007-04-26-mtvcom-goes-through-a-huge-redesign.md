<p><a href="http://www.mtvlabs.tv/2007/04/new-html-mtvcom.html">MTV.com goes through a huge redesign</a>. Very little flash makes the pages super fast to load. I remember not visiting specifically because the pages loaded so slow. The bigger news might be that they got rid of full page interstitials... my god I hope that becomes a trend.
