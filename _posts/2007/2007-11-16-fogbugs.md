The <a href="http://media.fogcreek.com/fogcreek.com/FogBugz/60movie/60movie.html">screencast for Jole Spolsky's FogBugs</a> is definitely one of the most amusing product demonstrations out there. So much better then their competition <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/demos/dashboard/">37 Signals' BaseCamp in which Jason will put you to sleep with his demonstrations</a>.
