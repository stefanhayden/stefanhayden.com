Gmail is finally showing me the new interface. Most of the new features are supposed to be backend but there are a few features of note. The contact manager is more robust and with the ability to add people's IM from other services. It's unclear if gtalk will actually let me talk to them though the gtalk client but I wait with baited breath.

The new contact manager is nice but still sadly under powered. I know too many people with multiple emails and I really want a better way to merge multi email addresses in to a single contact.
