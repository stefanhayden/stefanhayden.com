Will Ferrell seems to have realised that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319343/">his</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/">string</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396269/">of</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374536/">successful</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384642/">movies</a> are about to pigeon hole him. <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/strangerthanfiction/medium.html">Stranger then Fiction</a> look like it might fix that with some good writing and a captivating plot. This movie looks good with or without star power and since Will is in it there seems to be enough money in this movie to bring a lot of other stars on board.
