<a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/updates-to-gmail-contact-manager.html">Gmail has updated it's contact manager</a>. It still saves every email address you come across but it stores them separately. I used to have 900 contacts and now I have 200 contacts I have emailed and 700 that have just come across my path. Managing contacts just got a little more sane.

I've been waiting for Google to spin out the contact manager as it's own app for a long time now. There is no good contact manager online and Gmail has treated their as more of an after thought then a well polished feature.
