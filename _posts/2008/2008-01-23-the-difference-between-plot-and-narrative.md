<a href="http://voxcrock.blogspot.com/2005/05/nabokov-on-difference-between.html">The difference between plot and narrative</a>:
<blockquote>"The term 'narrative' is often confused with the term 'plot,' but they're not the same thing. If I tell you that the king died, and then the queen died, that's not narrative; that's plot. But, if I tell you that the king died, and then the queen died of a broken heart, that's narrative."</blockquote>
