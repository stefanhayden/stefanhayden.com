<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2008/05/16/firefox-3-release-candidate-now-available-for-download/">FireFox 3 RC1</a> has some small but good updates from the beta 5 version. One of the biggest eye sores was fixed in the auto complete url bar. The typography and color make it much more organized and easier to read. The little design changes always make me happy.
