There did not seem to be as much blow back about how much sxsw sucks as there has been in previous years. In case you are deciding if you should attend next year here is a list of the only people who should really attend SXSW:
<ol>
	<li>You've just heard of the internet and it sounds cool.</li>
	<li>You love parties and your friends from all over the world will be arriving as well.</li>
	<li>You are a panelist</li>
</ol>
Otherwise stay home.
