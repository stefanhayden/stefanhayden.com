From <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080917_005420.html">Cringely on the difference betten leadership and management</a>:
<blockquote>Most start-ups are fractal in their nature, especially those that have exciting visions and get everyone on the same page with collective purpose, goals, and objectives. Most investors, however, are bought into the conventional org chart; when the company devolves into top-down, the turnover begins.Â </blockquote>
