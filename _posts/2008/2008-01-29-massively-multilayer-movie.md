I'm actually excited about this <a href="http://www.secondskinfilm.com/">Second Skin</a> documentary. It seems that they do not focus too much on the average player but on the big stories but it will still be interesting to see those stories. should go well with the <a href="http://www.getlamp.com/">Get Lamp</a> movie which I've also been waiting for.
