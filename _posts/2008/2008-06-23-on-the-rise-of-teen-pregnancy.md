<a href="http://ypulse.com/archives/2008/06/the_role_of_the.php">I just posted this over at YPulse</a> and wanted to post it here as well to get some more thoughts. Currently it rings true to me but on the other hand I could be way off base.
<blockquote>I would almost say it seems to feed on it self. Pregnancy among disadvantaged teens has always been high. And I would almost call a lot of these young celebrities disadvantaged as well, even if it is in a completely different way.

With so much pressure and control from the outside world I could imagine a person retreating to a place they can't be controlled, their bodies. Having a baby was something they could make their own choice and in the end also give them something to do that isn't part of their career.

With these celebrities taking control it only encourages others to take control as well.

The reason I shy away from blaming movies like Juno and Knocked Up (besides the fact that I loved both movies) is that these movies are about dealing with irresponsibility and mistakes. But when you come to the real world it does seem to be that teens are clearly actively choosing to get pregnant.

Am I wrong? A lot of this is right from the gut where Colbert has taught me to think from.</blockquote>
