Some one has <a href="http://doctorhorrible.net/introducing-dr-horrible-comic-con/178/">video up of the Dr Horrible</a> <a href="http://doctorhorrible.net/comic-con-panel-videos/177/">panel at ComiCon</a>. The audio is pretty bad to the point of not really be fun to listen too. I don't get why conventions have not started selling high quality video on itunes for 5$ or something.
