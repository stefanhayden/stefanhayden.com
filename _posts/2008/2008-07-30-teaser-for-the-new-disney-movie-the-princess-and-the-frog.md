The <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/princessandthefrog/">teaser for the new Disney movie The Princess and the Frog</a> is out but it's not really getting me very excited even though John Lasseter is in the background somewhere. There is already a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Frog#Controversy">controversy</a> around this film as it's the first black lead in a Disney movie. Is it just me or does the lead just look like a white girl with a medium tan? (via <a href="http://www.notcot.org">notcot</a>)
