Last time I was this excited about a movie was Speed Racer. A movie I have yet to see as it got trashed in the reviews although I think they were probably harsher then they needed to be. <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/startrek/">StarTrek does looks awesome and I'm excited anway</a>. I hate J.J. Abrams as his TV shows ask awesome questions that never get answered. Perhaps he'll do better with a movie that forces answerers? I didn't see Cloverfeild so I don't know how that part of his film making came though. Keri just started watching Felicity but I haven't seen enough of it to judge one way or the other... I'm just rambling now.
