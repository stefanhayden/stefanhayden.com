confused about the bailout? Didn't read the 110 page document released this Sunday? <a href="http://www.clusterstock.com/2008/9/analyzing-the-bailout-what-s-in-it-anyway-">Here's a great break down of what we are getting our selves into</a>. It seems better then the original 1 page document that simply had the phrase "money please" on it.
