In general I'm bad at blog anniversaries. I never remember what day I started almost 4 years ago. But <a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/2008/07/29/thomas-friedman-is-a-really-cheese-speaker/">2 posts ago</a> was my 1000th post. Which I think is kinda cool even if the post is a little bit of a throw away. I've never been very poignant.
