Internet privacy can be a weird thing. There are somethings about your life that you might not want to talk about online but are hard to avoid.

<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/03/fine-news.html">Cory Doctorow just announced his new baby</a> <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/%7Erbear/defence.html">Poesy</a>   <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WpankhurstE.htm">Emmeline</a>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a>  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6538">Nautilus</a>  <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/">Taylor</a>  <a href="http://craphound.com/">Doctorow</a>. And before I thought about what a long and crazy name that is I though, "wait... with who?" Cory never has mentioned any sort of life partner or marrage and what I also find odd is that no one else has even mentioned it off hand either.

But what's that second to last name? <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/">Taylor</a>? Oh Alice Taylor from that awesome Wonderland blog. She's not a historical figure at all. It would be kind of weird to name your kid after a blog you like. So is Alice the mother? She does not seem to mention anything on her blog but she's probably been busy birthing so I'll give her a break.

If you do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=Cory+Doctorow+Alice+Taylor&amp;btnG=Search">google search for Cory and Alice</a> you can kind of guess. Wow they are in a lot of the same places at the same time and have a bunch of back to back interviews with the same media outlets at the same time. Coincidence? Probably not. Perhaps this is well known and I'm just really slow, which is often the case.

I don't mean to stalk though I clearly am (That's what the internet is for, isn't it?). It's just when a friend who I didn't know was dating anyone tells me they just had a kid my mind starts to spin a little.
