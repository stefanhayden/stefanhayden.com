<a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/oped/two_minutes_and_42_seconds_in_heaven.php">Two Minutes and 42 Seconds in Heaven</a> says no song should be longer then 2:42 (<a href="http://2m42s.muxtape.com/">muxtape</a>). A quick look at my collection and out of  14 songs I only think two are really amazing. "Leave The Biker" by Fountains of Wayne and "Love Like Her" by The Candy Butchers. But in general I agree with the sentiment and think the power pop I love does tend to be on the short side.
