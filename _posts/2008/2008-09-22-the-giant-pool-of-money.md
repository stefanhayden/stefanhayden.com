I'm not a big fan of NPR and This American Life. I find them over produced and oftain about fluff that I don't care about. Recently they had an episode about the morgage crisis call <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1242">The Giant Pool of Money</a> that actually worked for thier over produced ways. If you want to know about this mess of money it's a great hour long show to listen to.
