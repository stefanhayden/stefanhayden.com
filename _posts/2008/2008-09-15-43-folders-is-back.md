I subscribed to 43 Folders what seems like years ago and then got tired of the post volume about ways to organize my organizers. But <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/43Folders/~3/plVpAsPPcZ8/time-attention-creative-work">it seems like the site is making a come back</a>. 

<blockquote>This is now a site for people who want to finish things that they care about â€” but who still occasionally need help, inspiration, and the courage to push all the bullshit off their work table. This is about clearing that space every day, and then using it to do cool stuff that makes you proud.</blockquote>

One of the best things about blogs is how they have a life span. People blog for a reason and over time reasons change and priorities shift. It's sad when blogs lose focus but the best blogs know how to take a rest and then relaunch with new focus and new ideas. Welcome back Merlin.
