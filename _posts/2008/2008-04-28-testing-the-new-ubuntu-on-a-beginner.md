A great if albeit sexist named article about <a href="http://contentconsumer.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/is-ubuntu-useable-enough-for-my-girlfriend/">testing the new Ubuntu on a beginner</a>. I would say it mirrors my over all feeling that for the most part the OS works great but it's biggest problem seems to be the programs and how the OS interacts with them. Finding linux programs needs to be easier, Installing needs to be easier and help with where the program went after installing could be better as well.
