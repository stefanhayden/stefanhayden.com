A new game has appeared on youtube unbenounced to the people playing it. Author Geocaching consists of an author signing a book in a book store (preferably their own; <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Lz-sF57otRk">jump to the 3 min mark</a>) and then <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=VZjk28k0n0o">a fan rushing to the store to find it</a>. I hope more authors expand this idea. Perhaps reshelving the book in a fun place.
