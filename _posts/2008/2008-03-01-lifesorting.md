<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/35_lifestreamin_apps.php">The problem with lifestreaming applications</a> is that they are copying the wrong part of the facebook feed. Facebook is good at sorting and showing only what you would be interested. It's not the news items it shows. It's the ones it choses not to show that make it great. So where is my lifeÂ  sorting application?
