<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080109-beta-testing-a-novel-using-amazons-kindle.html">Beta-testing a novel using Amazon's Kindle</a>. This idea would work really will for non-fiction but also interesting for fiction. Though being a slight traditionalist I doubt I would enjoy reading a non finalized version of the book. I'm weird when it comes to cannon and enjoy having a tome of text that will forever be unchanged. But who knows if even that idea will hold up over time or not.
