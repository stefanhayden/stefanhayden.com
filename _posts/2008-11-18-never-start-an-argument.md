The old phrase was:
<blockquote>"Never argue with a man who buys ink by the gallon." (luckily women who bought ink that way were still fair game :P)</blockquote>
The new phrase should be:
<blockquote>"Never start an argument with someone who buys bandwidth by the gigabyte."</blockquote>
Though as bandwidth prices drop this will eventually just become:
<blockquote>"Never start an argument with someone."</blockquote>
