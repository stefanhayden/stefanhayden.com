The term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacn_(electronic)">bacn</a> has been around for a while now. But it can easily turn in to spam.

I sign up for a lot of sites and I will often opt in to their emails. After a while though I might want to opt back out. Some companies are good and provide a 1 click or even 2 click way to stop getting email.

Buy if you require me to log in to unsubscribe then you have lost my trust. I'm now marked you as spam. I know if enough people do the same you will start having a lot of trouble getting in to the inbox.

So I'm just sending out my warning now. Let me unsubscribe in piece or feel the wrath of my spam button.
