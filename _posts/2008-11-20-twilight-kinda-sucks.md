The fact that online (and especially youtube) interest in Harry Potter seems to cross over with Twilight alot is pretty frusterating. Though as time goes on more and more "fans" seem to becoming at least down on the side of "awesomely bad". Â <a href="http://io9.com/5093688/twilight-should-shed-its-vampire-drag-and-embrace-its-sappy-self">Over at i09 they have a very good take down of why the movie is a faithful adaptation of a poorly written book</a>. Hint: it's mostly weak characterization.
