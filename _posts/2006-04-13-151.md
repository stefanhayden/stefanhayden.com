<a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google calendar</a> is awesome. I'd review it but you can read a review over at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/12/google-calendar-is-live/">Techcrunch</a>.

My quick notes are that I love the tiny blue menu in the top left. I like the idea of easily switching between the different google services. If only it was on the other google pages. It's much more useful then the current account info on the top right corner.

So far there is no Gmail integration but I'm sure they want to get the bugs out of it and get it working before they grind both services to a halt.

There also doesn't seem to be a way to group edit a calendar. Hopefully this does become the feature they never implement. The ability to create groups in Gmail took over a year.

<b>Update:</b> They added the blue menu to gmail! But doh! They made the links open in a new window! I wanted to SWITCH between them not open more windows. At the very least I'd like to be able to edit that in the settings.
