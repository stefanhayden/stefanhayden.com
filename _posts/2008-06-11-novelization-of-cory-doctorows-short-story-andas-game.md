OMG! A <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/cory_doctorow/5">novelization of Cory Doctorow's short story "Anda's Game."</a> One of my favorite stories. Anda's Game made me want to read the Charles Stross' Halting State. Although I quickly abandoned it since it was writen in the second person.
