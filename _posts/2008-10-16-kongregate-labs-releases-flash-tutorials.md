Flash is super hard and there really are not enough good tutorials out there. Kongregate has released some awesome <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/pages/kongregate-labs">flash tutorials on making a side scrolling shooter</a>. They assume you know nothing about flash so it's a great starting point.
