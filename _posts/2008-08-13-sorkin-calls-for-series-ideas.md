In a <a href="http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/08/why-does-aaron.html">recent interview with GQ Aaron Sorkin mentioned that he was talking to HBO and was looking for series ideas</a> (He was half joking). But I have had a killer idea for Sorkin and HBO would be the perfect place for it. He should redo the West Wing but do it for a poor war torn country in Africa. It would keep all the drama of the West Wing but have a completely different set of obstacles to over come. Pressure from super powers, constant bankruptcy, military takeovers and other problems that only poor African countries have.
