Is marvel creating a <a href="http://io9.com/387332/its-all-super+soldiers-and-gods-in-upcoming-marvel-movies">mini marvel universe in their blockbuster movies</a>? One off used to be their thing. Spiderman here and X-Men there. But with SHEILD introduced at the end of Iron Man and the mention of Avengers might they be trying to tie a lot of these moves together. Their list of up coming movies makes it seem like they might be more intertwined in the future. Iron Man's second movie on April 30, 2010, Thor's movie on June 4, 2010, First Avenger: Captain America on May 6, 2011, and The Avengers in July 2011. Sounds like a great build up to the Avenger's movie.
