While this probably kills my hopes and dread of made for TV movies and awesome reality shows <a href="http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/06/23/pregnancy-pact-called-into-doubt/">it seems the "baby pact" has been called in to question</a>. In a story that makes more sense in 2007 there were 4 pregnant teens and in 2008 there are 16ish. To explain this the principal has basically manufactured a wild story to explain is and probaly to enact some kind of draconian rules.

I went to high school during the Oklahoma Bombing incident and know too many stories of principals thinking up wild stories to get dumb litmus tests put in place. No trench coats, no red bandannas, no blue bandannas, no males with makeup, and on and on. I'll bet it was the principal who blamed the day care center at the school as well and he's been inching to shut it down.
