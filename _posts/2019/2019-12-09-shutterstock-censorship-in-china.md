[TechCrunch has an article covering Shutterstock, its censoring, and my departure.](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/08/in-wake-of-shutterstocks-chinese-censorship-american-companies-need-to-relearn-american-values/) It's a great article and I hope you read it. It is a complex issue. I hope Shutterstock finds a way to take a stance other then saying it will follow local laws and do any censoring needed to keep it's partnerships.
