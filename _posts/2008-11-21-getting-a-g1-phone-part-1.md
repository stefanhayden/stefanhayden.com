My god I hope this series does not have many parts.

Keri and I decided to buy our google phones in Walmart for the discount. We knew there could be problems as we are currently with verizon and wanted to transfer our numbers. A lot to handle for walmart employees.

They were nice enough and two hours later we had our phones and were out the door. We were assured that in three to four hours our phones would be working.

Now three to four hours later we have google phones that will not let us sign in. Awesome.

I tried to call several T-mobile help numbers but all said they did not recognise my verizon number. So I guess I'm off to a t-mobile store tommarow. I hope we're at least in thier data base of customers.
