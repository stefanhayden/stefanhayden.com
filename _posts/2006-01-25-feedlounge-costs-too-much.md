<a href="http://www.feedlounge.com">Feedloung</a> is open to the public for $5 a month. Two months ago when <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> was dragging it's feet I would have jumped all over it. Now that blogline is up and running at it's new host everything is nice and smooth and I don't feel the need for a monthly fee (or a one time yearly subscription). As much as I want bells and whistles with my feed reader all I really want is it to be fast.

While it seemed extremely buggy, <a href="http://www.bloxor.com">Blox0r</a>, will probably be the direction I want to go in. I'd be perfectly happy to install my own open source feed reader on my own hosting and use that. I'd love to have that much control over my data.

Now if <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> would just fix their server problems.
