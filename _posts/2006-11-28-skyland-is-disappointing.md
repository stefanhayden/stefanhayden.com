<p>I had mentioned before that I was excited about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyland">Skyland</a>, a new animated show on NickToons. The show's premise is that earth has shattered in to millions of little pieces that orbit around the core which is just a very inventive idea to build on. The show is beautiful rendered in all 3d. The back grounds are stunning and the cell shading on the characters is awesome.</p>
<p>Sadly it ends there. The writing is horrible and stiff and it's not helped buy the bad voice acting. The characters are poorly animated and seems jerky and removed. It's a little painful to watch and I can't say I'll be watching many more in the future. Makes me glad that Avatar gets every element of their show just right.
