<p><a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google's RSS Reader has just gotten a major update</a> to function a lot more like a standard RSS reader. I have to say I'm highly impressed. They have a lot of work to do to convince me to move from <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> but I am very interested so far. I'll hopefully give a more comprehensive review this weekend.
