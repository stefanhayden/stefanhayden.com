<p>When I was in high school I wanted to write a paper about how being a vegetarian was not all good. Sadly none of the research I did could bring up any anti-vegetarian literature. <a href="http://www.utne.com/issues/2007_142/features/12607-1.html">The Dark Side of Soy</a> is the first article I have talking about how not everything is good in large quantities, even vegetables.
