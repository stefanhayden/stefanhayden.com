<a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=301249153&amp;blogID=345065393">Diablo Cody recommended River's Cuomo's new album</a>Â  <span class="reviewtitle fn">"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00110JDUQ/ref=nosim/sthayden-20/">Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo</a>" and I'm tentatively excited.
