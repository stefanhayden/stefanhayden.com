This would have been great if some of it was in Michael Moore file Sicko as it got so much publicity. I'm no expert on medicine but it seem pretty obvious our entire health system is pretty messed up. So it's no too surprising that birth has the same problems.

It's even so ingrained that in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1878067583/stefanhayden-20">Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes</a>, which tried to reverse all gender stereotypes, the women still had births in a hospital instead of with a midwife.
