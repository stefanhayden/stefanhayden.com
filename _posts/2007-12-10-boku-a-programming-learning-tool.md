<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/12/10/matt-maclaurin-on-creative-expression-with-boku/">Jon Udell has a great interview with the creator of a new learning tool for the xbox called Boku</a> that is meant to teach basic programming in a really fun and interesting way. It just was previewed at Microsoft's TechFest and there is not much to look at but here is a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=RY5jLau-MZk">short clip from youtube that looks cool</a> and even makes sense after listening to the interview.
