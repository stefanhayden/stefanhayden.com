Just bought an old xbox game for my xbox 360. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia:_Warrior_Within">Prince of Persia: Warrior Within</a>. It was cheep but I forgot to check the list of backwards compatible xbox games which to date only stands at 394 games. Perhaps my fault but still disappointing.

Similarly I was with some friends who just discovered the Wii and were looking to buy one. Why does GameStop have empty Wii boxes behind the counter? They were about to drop over a thousand dollars on Wiis (for family and friends wanted them too) untill they were finally told those boxes we all empty. Kinda ridiculous.
