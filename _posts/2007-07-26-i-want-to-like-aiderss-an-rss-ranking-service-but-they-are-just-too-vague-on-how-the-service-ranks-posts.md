<a href="http://www.aiderss.com/">I want to like AideRSS, an rss ranking service, but they are just too vague on how the service ranks posts</a>. Feed reading is such a niche power user activity that they want to know more about the secrete sauce before they commit to it. Though I think part of my problem is that I am a filter style blogger and I want to be the one finding obscure post and shining a light on them.
