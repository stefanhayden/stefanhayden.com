Season 1 Review:

This show was pretty good for a Zack Snyder which I usually don't love. Many of the charcaters seem to start out pretty bland and hard to distinguis but I think it got better as the series went on.

Many episodes are very horny in a way few animations are and in a way different then any anime I have seen is. There is a lot of sex and nudity. Some nudity was not sexualized which is rare in any media.

While I had a hard time getting in to it by the end I was fully invested. The animation style is very nice.
