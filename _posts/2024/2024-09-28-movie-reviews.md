## Fantastic Mr. Fox

4 stars


just a very chill and nice movie.


## Land of Bad

2.5 stars


little dose of American jingoism.


## Polite Society

4.5 stars


What a amazing movie. Blending romcom and action movie seamlessly. Amazing writing, acting, production, and stunt coordination.


## Baby Driver

4 stars

a fun movie with a lot of actors that have aged very poorly. I've wanted to watch this since Thomas Flight had his great opening breakdown of the movie. www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNGYsmTPWug
