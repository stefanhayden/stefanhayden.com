A tweet on mastodon is called a "Post".

Before Nov 14, 2022 they were called [Toots](https://gizmodo.com/mastodon-toot-retired-twitter-tweet-equivalent-1849786221). This was fun but mostly was due to a misunder standing of the english meaning.

this is in responce to this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyV54qfSZwg) that arguest that all text posts on social networks should be called tweets which to me makes no sense. 
The idea that a post on twitter with an image and a image on instagram with text should have a different name because of some fundimental valuye of how it is displayed is wild. The only reason
these things ever have different names is for corperate branding purposes.

In a federated world a text post with an image can be displayed differently on different platforms so the way a post is made has no bearing on how it is displayed.
