Yet another amazing video about how <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279&hl=en">banks create money from nothing</a> and how eventually the entire system will crumble. It's kind of sad that so many documentaries can expose such fundamental flaws in the world that are never talked about.
