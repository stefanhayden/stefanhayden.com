<a href="http://www.nypl.org/">The New York Public Library</a> has been taking <a href="http://print.google.com/">notes from goggle</a>. They have made <a href="http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/index.cfm">illuminated manuscripts, historical maps, vintage posters, rare prints and photographs, and illustrated books available for free online</a>. Most seems to be in the public domain and the library is only asking for some sort of fee for high-resolution version of the images, though I can’t find out how much.

As a poor graphic artist new to the field I’m always happy to find new places to get stock photography. Hopefully this is a sign that this digitizing of the past is not just a trend and will really take off. The more power at the tip of my fingers the happier I am.
