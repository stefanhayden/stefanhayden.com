My old dell died a rather sudden and upsetting death. Dell said a new motherboard would be 500$ and so this build below was right around 1k. I heard a ton of mixed reviews about <a href="http://www.ibuypower.com/">iBuyPower</a>. It seems some people had some really bad experiences with them. But 2 things stuck out for me. The first was the price. I really think this is a great build for only a thousand dollars. And 2 is the fact that I could get it with-out Windows. I own windows and I don't need to buy it again. But sadly no Linux option.

I've only had it for a day but everything seems to be in good shape. Here are the specs which are mostly for my future reference:
