<p>"<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/01/scitech/pcanswer/main1853357.shtml">Last week the House of Representatives passed a well-meaning but ill-conceived piece of Internet safety legislation that could actually make the Internet a more dangerous place for children and teens.</a>" The mainstream media really needs to cover this even more then it is. CBS is on the short list so far.
