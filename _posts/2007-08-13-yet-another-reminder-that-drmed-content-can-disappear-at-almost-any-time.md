<p><a href="http://newteevee.com/2007/08/10/google-shutting-down-paid-video/">Yet another reminder that DRMed content can disappear at almost any time. If you bought any video from google video it's now gone forever.</a> I'd love to see a law suit come out of this that forced cooperations to release any DRMed media that was being discontinued. It would be good for the consumer and make content creators worry about releasing DRMed files.
