<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/09/15/a-conversation-with-ed-iacobucci-about-the-reinvention-of-air-travel/">Airplane trips shorter than 500 miles, flying was no faster than driving</a>. I opened up google maps to take a look and it seems on some level I already knew this was true. In general this seem really far. I would love to see that number to come down to 100 miles.
