So I've been using FireFox 3 (beta 4) which is a little hard as I lean pretty hard on a lot of plugins (and they don't work in the beta). I can say it's pretty amazing. Traditionally I use FireFox untill my computer grinds to a halt, which can be several times a day.

FF3 is currently runing at a slim 128mb while FF2 oftain hit 300 or 400 megs. The Vista icons were a bit shocking at first but they are actually quickly growing on me.
