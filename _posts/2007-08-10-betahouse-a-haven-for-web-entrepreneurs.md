<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/08/10/betahouse____a_haven_for_web_entrepreneurs/?page=1">This is a pretty good article at boston.com about the new startup community that's building in boston</a>. Boston has a history of start ups but the west coast has always had a leg up on the social scene which boston is just peacing together now. Boston doesn't have as many people as the valley but with such a small town you think the tech folk would meet up more then they do.
