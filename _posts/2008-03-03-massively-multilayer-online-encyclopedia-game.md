<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21131">This article is the single best article about wikipedia I have ever read</a>. It's really embodies the enthusiasm that make me want to edit and organize wikipedia. I for a short time was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguator</a>. It's amazing how many small tiny roles there are to fill in wikipedia and how much you feel like you are helping everyone towards a goal like any good MMO should. I really want the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596515162/stefanhayden-20">Wikipedia: The Missing Manual</a> as it might help me to better understand and jump in to wikipedia a bit more whole heartedly.
