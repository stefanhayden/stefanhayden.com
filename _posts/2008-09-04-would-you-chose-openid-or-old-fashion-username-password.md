It's been about a week (was it two?) since I added a normal registration with username and password to <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com">Books I Am Reading</a>. Based on the people who hate OpenID I would have guessed that OpenID registration would have plummited. In fact it has stayed strong. Obviously OpenID has a stronger user base then you might think.
