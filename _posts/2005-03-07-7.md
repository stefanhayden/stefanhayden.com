Ever since I saw <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/standup/central/detail.jhtml?p=/comedians/m/demetri_martin.xml">Demetri on comedy central</a> Iâ€™ve wanted him to come to <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu">TCNJ</a>. A very unassuming little kid, his downplayed sarcastic humor really makes it even better in my book.

I was sad to see he was going to be in the <a href="http://www.ucbtheatre.com/">UCB theater</a> mere days before I was going to UCB. Keri and I were going to go after we did the audio tour of The <a href="http://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a>, because everything is better with an audio tour.

UCB is always cheep but when the <a href="http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/03/07/demetri_ucb.php">Gothamist</a> pointed out the $8 tickets on sale to see him tonight it showed there is still plenty of time bring him to TCNJ. Hopefully I can put the lean on <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~cub">the board</a> to bring his greatness to light.
