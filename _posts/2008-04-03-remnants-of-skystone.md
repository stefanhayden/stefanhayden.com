<a href="http://www.remnantsofskystone.com/blog/">Remnants of Skystone</a> is a flash based MMO that also happens to be steampunk... sweet. There is a lot of talk about flashed based MMOs lately and I'm kind of excited about them as hopfully they need less time then WoW to play. <a href="http://liladreams.creatrixgames.com/">Lila Dreams</a> is another one I've been following.
