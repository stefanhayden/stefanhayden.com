This <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/alttext/2008/06/alttext_0618">Cooking With the Dungeons & Dragons is hilarious</a>. A lot of this seems to support the criticism toward D&D that it's focus is too rules based. I've always heard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS">GURPS was better</a> as it required more imagination and didn't fall back on rules systems as much.
