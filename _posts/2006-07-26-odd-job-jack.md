<p><a href="http://www.oddjobjack.com/">Odd Job Jack</a>, a Canadian cartoon, is releasing the <a href="http://www.oddjobjack.com/freejack.php">master flash files with all art work for all 13 episodes</a>. I can't stop thinking about what an amazing resource this will be for art students. A lot of time you get stuck at the beginning of a project because there so much work you need to do before you can start making a flash movie. This will be great for people who want to focus on content creation instead of endless illustration.
