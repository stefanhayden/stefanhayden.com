<p><a href="http://chimprawk.blogspot.com/">Fred Stutzman</a> continues to be one of the only people who has any right to talk about social networks. I've been saying this for a while but he often says it much better.</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:150%;"><p>"Unfortunately, since [Facebook] are ego-centric, there's no way to sustain this network in the long-haul." (<a href="http://chimprawk.blogspot.com/2007/11/social-network-transitions.html">link</a>)</p>
