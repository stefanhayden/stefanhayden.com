<a href="http://braid-game.com/news/?p=129">This is a really great speech about where video games are today and where they need to go in the future</a>. Jonathan is super critical of most games today saying they offer artificial rewards to encourage game play instead of building game machanics that encourage game play with out the need of artificial rewards. Like Jonathan I also agree that WoW is a great example of this transgression.
