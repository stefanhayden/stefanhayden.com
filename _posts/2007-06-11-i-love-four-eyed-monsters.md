<p><img src="http://foureyedmonsters.com/images/dvd/300_tall_cover_of_dvd.jpg" width="130" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 10px; ">I watched <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=k8rRFFi_stY">Four Eyed Monsters this weekend since it was up on youtube</a> and it took over my whole day.</p>
<p>Four Eyed Monsters is not a documentary but is a autobiographical story of Arin and Susan that include a lot of the original artifacts (video/writing) that they created before and during their relationship.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is the movie continues. Since the story is about their immediate past the production of this movie is directly related to the movie. <a href="http://foureyedmonsters.com">There is tons of podcasts and behind the scenes stuff online</a> but I think I'm going to have to buy the dvd to show people.
</p>
<p>Oh and even better Susan is from Malden which is where I currently am as well.</p>
