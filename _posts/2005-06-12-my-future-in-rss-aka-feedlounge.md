<a href="http://feedlounge.com/">FeedLounge</a> launched it's alpha version (is that really a launch?) just days ago and it's already generating a lot of buzz. From the sound of it I'm already preparing to make the switch. <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2005/06/10/feedlounge/3/">Reading others talk about rss</a> I'm always surprised by the number of people who use desktop rss readers. As a college student (just graduated) I almost can not imagine that. Living in a world where I was up in campus life or the art labs for hours (or days) on end with out my rss reader handy is a painful thought. For these reason whenever I have been given a choice between desktop and web solutions I always chose web. <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> has served me in the way hotmail did the job in the 90s. Bloted, clumsey (ewww frames), hard to find help. I found the Bloglines' help forum once and have never been able to find my way back to it since. I had hoped a quick redesign would have happened once <a href="http://www.ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a> bought it as several of <a href="http://picasa.com/">google's purchases</a> <a href="http://maps.google.com">seem to have undergone</a>.

Bloglines was my first love and really introduced me to rss. I will never forget bloglines but I've been ready for a new rss relationship for a while now. I knew some one somewhere was working on a better solution and I think FeedLounge will be it.
