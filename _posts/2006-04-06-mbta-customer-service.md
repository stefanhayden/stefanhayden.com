I just called the <a href="http://www.mbta.com">Boston Transit Authoritie's</a> customer service. The number was <a href="http://www.mbta.com/contact_us/index.asp">easy to find on the web site</a>. A human picked up after only 2 rings. This has to be the best experience I've ever had with customer service in years.
