I don't like weezer's new song and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muP9eH2p2PI">as soon as I saw an internet meme in the music video</a> I was fully ready to hate the music video. But I think they do enough unique stuff with it to keep it original and interesting. At the very least people need to learn to let these memes go. We were all bord of them by the time they fizzled out in the first place.
