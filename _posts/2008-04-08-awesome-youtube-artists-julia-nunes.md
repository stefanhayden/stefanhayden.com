I love youtube more and more everyday. <a href="http://youtube.com/profile?user=jaaaaaaa">Julia is really awesome</a>. Come for the covers stay for the original songs. I had a hard time picking one to feature below. Also check out <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=4h8cGEKzSwI">Underdog by Spoon</a>.

Her editing style is also great layering video to get multiple tracks and harmony.
