Philip Reeve's book Larklight now has a sequel by the name of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Starcross-Larklight-2-Philip-Reeve/dp/0747589135">StarCross</a>. The US cover sucks, I'll have to import the UK version. It seems the series has also been optioned by Warner Brothers. (via <a href="http://www.brassgoggles.co.uk/brassgoggles">Brass Goggles</a>)
