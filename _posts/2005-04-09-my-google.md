For those who don't know <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has finally merged their <a href="http://www.keyhole.com/">Keyhole</a> satellite company with their map service and you can get a really nice view of north America from above. A very quick community sprung up around this feature and have been having a lot of fun with it. People are <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/memorymaps/pool/">using google maps and Flickr to create memory maps of their home town </a>or locations that have a lot of history with them.

Another fun site related to Google Maps is <a href="http://www.shreddies.org/gmaps/">Google Sightseeing </a>which has been collecting some of the more interesting photos of the world in to one blog.

In the future I see a My Google with the ability to add tags to the whole world. I could tag places I've been and maybe even plan out entire trips marking down where I want to stop with a note system similar to Flickrs'. Along with a system to date the notes you might be able to follow me as I travel around and take notes on the world by scrubbing through a time line, or a rang of times. Of course this would all be shareable with the ability to tag and organize notes and groups of notes.

Though I would not be any good at it I look forward to who ever takes their My Google map notes and uses the rss it publishes as their travel blog. I think that would be an interesting read.
