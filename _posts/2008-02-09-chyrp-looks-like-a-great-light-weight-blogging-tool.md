<a href="http://chyrp.net/">Chyrp looks like a great light weight blogging tool</a> ala tumbler. I've been moving my site over to a tumble like interface for a while now but it definitely feel like a hack in wordpress with custom fields all over the place. I'm considering jumping over but I'll need to a bit more research if I can import old wordpress posts and mirror the same URL structure.
