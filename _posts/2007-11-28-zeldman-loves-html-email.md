<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/11/28/give-html-email-a-chance/">Zeldman backpedals on HTML Email as fast as he can</a>. It only took him <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/06/08/e-mail-is-not-a-platform-for-design/">5 months</a> to figure out he was about to become irrelevant in the web standards community.

I have a hard time he really want from <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/06/08/e-mail-is-not-a-platform-for-design/">hating it</a>:
<blockquote>"I mean it sucks because nobody needs it. It impedes rather than aids communication."</blockquote>
To now loving it. Something tell me hating HTML email just became bad for business.
