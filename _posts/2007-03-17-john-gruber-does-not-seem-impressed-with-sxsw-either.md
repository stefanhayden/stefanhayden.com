<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/sxsw_2007_panel">John Gruber does not seem impressed with sxsw either</a>. “But the nebulous nature of art puts more emphasis on the need for speakers to add structure, clarity, and preparation to their presentations.” How do I not fall in love with that quote? </p>
<p style="display:block; margin:10px 0px 0px 0px;">I did not know I was in such good company in sxsw disappointment. If so many people think this lowly about sxsw 2007 I would not be surprised if attendance drops next year. A conference can't run on parties alone.
