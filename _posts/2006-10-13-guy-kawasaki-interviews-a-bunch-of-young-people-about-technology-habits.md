<p><a href="http://www.veotag.com/player/?u=wgcqpthubc">Guy Kawasaki interviews a bunch of young people about technology habits</a>. I felt really young watching this as all the answers seemed fairly obvious. I'm always surprised at how misinterpreted some of the answers get. P.S. The <a href="http://www.veotag.com/">Veotag</a> video player is really cool.
