Anil has alway been one of my many internet heros. He has a <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2008/10/in-defense-of-marriage.html">great post up about how marage is awesome</a>. Â Alot of the talk about marrage these days seems to be either from the gay community or the religeous community. Anil and I both come at marrage from an angle, one where the point is just chosing to spend all your time with one awesome person. So much of marrage has little to do with <a href="http://www.noonprop8.com/">gender</a> or<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia"> race</a> of the other person and much more about chosing someone to trust completly. I hope prop 8 goes well in California. I think it will but the polls seem relativly tight and I think if the libral state of California can't pass this then a lot of other states are going to have an even harder time.
