<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0765352877/stefanhayden-20">Earthseed</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Sargent">Pamela Sargent</a> was one of my favorite books from junior high. It was out of print and I had a hard time finding but I finally did and now it sits on my shelf waiting for <a href="http://www.yalit.com">Keri</a> to read it. Oddly enough 25 years after it was first published Pamela is coming out with a sequel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0765314274/stefanhayden-20">Farseed</a>) and seems to make a trilogy out of it. I want to be happy about it but I'm dubious instead. I wish Pamela the best of luck writing it.
