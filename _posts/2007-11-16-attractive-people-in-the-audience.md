I've always been a fan of the TED talks. All though this one about <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/192">Climate Change with David Keith</a> has been edited very strangely. Most times you only know an audience is there through laughter but this particular talk has all these edited reaction shots from attractive people in the audience. Who thought that was a good idea?
