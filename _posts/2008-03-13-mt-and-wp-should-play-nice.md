It's hard not to <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/03/wordpress-is-open-source/">agree with Matt on every point of difference</a> between Wordpress and Moveable type. It was true in early 2005 when I started blogging and it's still true today.

I'm a fan of Anil but <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/blog/2008/03/a-wordpress-25-upgrade-guide.html">the artical touting MT just seemed quaint</a>. The "features" seemed to amount to more minor criticisms of Wordpress then game changing technology.

I don't feel any anger towards Movable Type though. Nothing they said was untrue in any way. And they are simply doing the bast they can with the product they have. I wonder if they are in the same spot as microsoft. Needing to suport old MT installs and migrating them to a more dynamic solution could be close to impossible.
