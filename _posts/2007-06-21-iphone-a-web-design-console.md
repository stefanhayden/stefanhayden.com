<p>It's funny seeing designers talk about <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/475-designing-for-the-iphone-is-a-refreshing-experience">how great it is to make web apps for the iPhone</a>. From every one having a variable width to something very fixed on the iPhone.</p>
<p>This is the exact difference between PC games and Console games that game developers have fought with since the 80s. </p>
<p>This is just the first time web designers have a console.
