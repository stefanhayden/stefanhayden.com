In 2005, right around the time moveabletype was imploading, I started a wordpress blog. I used it a bunch. Social media had not taken over and RSS reader were just getting started.

But these days RSS readers are dead as everyone moved to twitter or other media sites.

And wordpress is hard to keep secure if you don't give it the love and care it needs.

So now I've exported all the posts to this jekyll which builds on github. It will have less hacking but lets see if I use it at all.
