This is only internet history for the few. if you love Joss Whedon, Warren Ellis, FireFly, or just comics in general you have to read this <a title="Joss vs Warren" href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=1848">comment war between Joss and Warren</a>. It has to be one of the most exciting things I've seen unfold before me I have ever witnessed.

This week has been full of crazy websites that no one but me would find funny but me. I hope this isn't one of them and others can get some enjoyment out of this as well.
