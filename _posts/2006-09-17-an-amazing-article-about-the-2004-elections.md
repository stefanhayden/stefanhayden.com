<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen">An amazing article about the 2004 elections</a> and how it did not match up with the exit polls which were the most scientific poll in history. ''virtually irrefutable evidence of vote miscount.'' The discrepancies, the experts add, ''are consistent with the hypothesis that Kerry would have won Ohio's electoral votes if Ohio's official vote counts had accurately reflected voter intent.''</p>
