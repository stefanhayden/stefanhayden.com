Hey. <a href="http://www.mikeviola.com/">Mike Viola has a new album out</a>. I'm pretty sure that's the girl who played with Mike when we saw him open for Fountains Of Wayne in one of the best concerts ever. And hey <a href="http://www.kellyjones.com/">Kelly Jones</a> seems pretty awesome (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/kellyjones">myspace</a>), so I just picked up her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J8QSR6/stefanhayden-20">most recent album</a>.
