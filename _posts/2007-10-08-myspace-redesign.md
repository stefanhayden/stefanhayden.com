<p>I don't check myspace every day so I don't know how new this is but if you log in and look up to the right there is a little <a href="http://home.myspace.com">link to a new homepage design</a>. I must say it is light years ahead of the rest of the site's design. </p>
<p>People have been calling for a redesign for years now and maybe it's finally starting to happen. In general it's pretty clean and organized. good job myspace design team!
