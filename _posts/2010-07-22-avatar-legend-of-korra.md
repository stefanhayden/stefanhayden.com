<blockquote style="font-size:20px;">The epicenter of the modern Avatar world is Republic City, a metropolis fueled by steampunk technology. It is a virtual melting pot where benders and non-benders from all nations live and thrive. - <a href="http://forums.avatarspirit.net/index.php?topic=18479.0">AvatarSpirit</a></blockquote>
