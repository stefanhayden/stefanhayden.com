<p>Memes really don’t seem to spread through the web design communities very much. <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/wheres_durstan.html">Where’s Dunstan</a> might be an exception to the rule only because it originated in the community and was encouraged. Not to be left out like I was for sxsw here’s my contribution, which is following the trend of a bit more abstract, as lead by <a href="http://www.boxofchocolates.ca/archives/2005/03/21/wheres-durstan">Derek</a>. </p>
