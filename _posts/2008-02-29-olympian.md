It seems that <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/Olympian_Bloggers">this year there will be a lot of Olympian bloggers</a>.Â  Also in the past two years video has exploded online. With so much talk in the past of <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/040811">the amount of sex that happens between Olympians</a> I give it a 50/50 chance of the first sex tape of two Olympians to make its round online this time. Finally a reason to watch the Olympics!
