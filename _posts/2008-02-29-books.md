<a href="http://io9.com/361597/the-twenty-science-fiction-novels-that-will-change-your-life">Great list of scifi books that you must read from i09</a>. I've read <a href="http://www.literature.org/authors/shelley-mary/frankenstein/">Frankenstein</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0345459407/stefanhayden-20">Perdido Street Station</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/076530953X/stefanhayden-20">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>. If Perdido can make the list then I also think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0553383574/stefanhayden-20">City of Saints and Madmen</a> needs to be on there as well.
