<p>Song 3:<a href="/mp3/Rapwing_Lair_1st_Half_Razorgore_-_Ebonroc_.mp3">Rapwing Lair pt1</a>, <a href="/mp3/Rapwing_Lair_2nd_Half_Flamegor_-_Nefarian_.mp3">Rapwing Lair pt2</a></p>
<p>Okay. This week is special. I am not really a rap fan. I have nothing against it. Just not my cup of tea. This song might not be the best rap song ever but I think it's worth listening to for educational value alone.</p>
<p>Rapwing Lair is an extensive "rhythmic project," as described by Connery, to detail how one defeats every single boss in Blackwing Lair in World of Warcraft while mixing disparate styles of hip hop. </p>
<p>It's really amazing to hear the different styles of rap. What makes the styles more clear to listen to is that the content is so different from mainstream rap that it's easier to focus on the rhyme and rhythm.</p>
<p><strong>The Styles include:</strong></p>
<p>Underground Hardcore<br />
Tupac Shakur Impersonation<br />
Dirty South - West Coast<br />
East Coast - New School<br />
Underground Hardcore<br />
Snoop Dogg Impersonation<br />
Jurassic 5 Impersonation<br />
NYC Gangsta-ish</p>

<p>Rapwing Lair<br />
Razorgore (Underground Hardcore)<br />
Blackwing Lair, zoned in as we phased through<br />
40-man crew, with 8 classes in the raid group<br />
So we know whats in store, MT controllin the orb<br />
Breaking the eggs to bring him out to phase 2<br />
Lets get it happenin, Hunters kitin dragonkin<br />
Running up and jumping down ramps for the fake route<br />
With the last egg down, Razorgore gonna break through<br />
The MC, MT settin the pace to<br />
DPS him down, Line of sight the fireballs<br />
Stay behind in spite before it bakes you<br />
So Off-Tank, stand at your 90-degree angle<br />
So when he breaths, it doesnt conflagrate you<br />
Slow and steady, Razorgore givin his paid dues<br />
Tier 2 bracers from his grave loot<br />
Then we line up, 40-man raid group<br />
To move to Vaels room, BWL Take 2</p>
<p>Vaelastrasz the Corrupt - (Midwest Story-Telling)<br />
Now hold up hold up, Im rememberin<br />
We need to kill some goblins for looting elementium<br />
Odd groups to the left, even groups to the right<br />
Attack the goblin mobs, dont lose them in sight<br />
Aight, Good Job, with a standing ovation<br />
Now line up on Vaels right in battle formation<br />
Tank 1s in front of the big 3<br />
Tank 4s got an FR of 315<br />
Vaelastrasz making one hell of a big scene<br />
Hes 30% life, do you wonder what this means?<br />
Everyone ready? Lemme do a head count<br />
Aight, start the encounter, essence of the red now<br />
Tank 1 in line gotta agro manage<br />
A healer for every class, theres no bandage<br />
Tank 1 BA, max out on the low damage<br />
Ok everyone stop, Rogues Vanish<br />
Hunters feign, lemme see the priests fade<br />
Cant no one OT when we move to each phase<br />
Tank 1s dead, tank 2 face him to the east<br />
Tank 2 watch where you placing the beast<br />
20% and hes getting hostile<br />
Mage BA, so move to the tail and start throwin out frost bolts<br />
Vaelastrasz gives out some of the better loot<br />
So Warrior DPS it, lets see some executes<br />
45 seconds, somebody check the time<br />
Tank 2 BA, tank 3 youre next in line<br />
Tank down, tank 3 make him turn around<br />
Aight hes got aggro, everybody burn him down<br />
Ah geez, stop having a laugh<br />
Paladins keep your groups up! Stop casting the hammers of wrath!<br />
Vael down, we all here did well<br />
Now we can loot the body for our tier 2 belts<br />
Aight everybody line up, matta fact<br />
Our next agenda is the next 2 death talon packs</p>
<p>Broodlord Lashlayer - (Tupac Shakur Impersonation)<br />
Aight MT you ready? Lets get this thang started</p>
<p>Aight now MT move to the middle, it aint a riddle<br />
Son, you gotta get the hatcher situated and settled<br />
Uh, Need that AoE on the whelps too<br />
Mages do it, Paladin bops are finna help you<br />
Once every pack is down, move to the corner<br />
Quiet on ventrilo son, we need order<br />
Nobody can die, healers take it personal<br />
Aight we done here, take it out the first floor<br />
Lets move to the second, we be wrecking<br />
Warrior sweeping strikes and blade flurries with weapons uh<br />
Move in and counterspell the healing prayer<br />
Gather your lifesavers, its Broodlord Lashlayer<br />
Now we at the corner before him, priests get out forts and<br />
Shield after mortal strike, thats important<br />
Warriors charge him, you got heals, no stressin<br />
Rogues heres your lesson, get on the suppression<br />
AoE Knockback, aint no way to stop that<br />
Broodlord on a new tank, Druids get them HoTs back<br />
Mages and locks, youre the cloth pack<br />
The tanks at 30%, lemme get a healer to top that<br />
Do what the raid leader says<br />
If we get a warrior down, we need a druid wit a battle rez<br />
I pulled aggro, looking like he wants to kill me<br />
I'll move to the tanks so some of y'all betta heal me<br />
Broodlord at 5 percent, pierce him through<br />
With everything you got for our tier 2 boots<br />
and DPS zerg him, and hes at dead rest<br />
Random 1000 if you need him for yo head quest<br />
Everyone line up<br />
We finna clear the trash mobs in front of Firemaw before the times up</p>
<p>Firemaw - (Dirty South - West Coast)<br />
MT, best be holdin' still<br />
gripping tight with a sword and shield, gotta keep it real, 9K AC with the plated steel<br />
gonna roll with Firemaw, how we gonna keep the fire off?<br />
the first warrior gonna need more than 315 FR<br />
Now listen here dude, priests gonna heal you<br />
and after shadow flame, priests gon shield you<br />
Now I'mma say it plenty times up in plenty rhymes<br />
That Fire Buffet stacks up way up over twenty times<br />
Name of the game is LOS, if you hit, call an SOS<br />
Here's the test for Firemaw, y'all gotta be the best of the best<br />
MT's in the corner, step up to the border<br />
so you don't get hit by the fire buffet, keep that order<br />
and go slower, on the dps so you don't pull<br />
and let me take a dura hit to make myself po'er<br />
let's get it on tonight, and stay organized<br />
when firemaw's beginning to cast wing buffet, then y'all taunt him right<br />
Offtanks get on Firemaw, cuz he deaggroes<br />
Now give him back to the main tank, I'm calling "DPS GO!"<br />
Let's make it happen, push to the front and y'all start casting<br />
But remember to move to the back when the fire buffet begins to stack 10<br />
We right in the action, He's at 5% let's drop this dragon<br />
And no homeboy, killing Firemaw does not increase faction<br />
Finishing blow, now we gon hear wassup<br />
Somebody link the loot, let's see them tier 2 gloves<br />
Done with that boss, y'all be like "that's all?"<br />
Nah dawg, now we finna clear some trash mobs</p>
<p>Trash Mob Packs - (East Coast - New School)<br />
Aight y'all cats in da raid group, y'all need to be with me<br />
And every warrior to the front, ready to assist me<br />
We ain't gonna stop till every boss in this place is gone<br />
So everyone take a breath, and put yo game faces on<br />
MT 1, 2 you're both on a warlock<br />
We'll DPS those first, assist using the fourth box<br />
I want a Hunter in the front that's armed with a full clip<br />
5,4,3,2,1, alright pull it<br />
MT 3, 5 you're on spellbinders, here's the reminder<br />
for MT 6, your mission is technicians<br />
The orc locks gotta die first, their AoE is savage<br />
Enraged Felguards, gimme a banish<br />
So keep the dps fast, and the heals competent<br />
Melee on Spellbinders, the rest ta kill goblins<br />
There's an overseer that's still wobblin<br />
So let's dps him down, and now the real problem is<br />
Not enough MT healing, throw a shield on to them<br />
Kill the last technician, and now I feel confident<br />
We can move on to the packs of wyrmguards<br />
Y'all need to keep in mind that each one of these things hurt hard<br />
Clearing this trash can take close to one hour<br />
So we need a off tank that's ready for bronze power<br />
Another backup for green, get up a network<br />
of healing for the tanks, and we're dropping the red first<br />
Once the wyrmguards are down, it's all rinse and repeat<br />
Ebonroc and Flamegor gon be seeing defeat...</p>
<p>Ebonroc (Underground Hardcore)</p>
<p>Check, Check, Check.</p>
<p>Raid Group with 20 killers, armed with 20 healers<br />
Locked down with a strategy that's proven to be plenty iller<br />
So get them buffs out, hunters with them guns out<br />
MT run down, and put him between any pillars<br />
Yeah I'm talking about that Drake Ebonroc, dawg<br />
Don't make me scream at you until I got lock jaw<br />
I ain't got a repair bot y'all, so drop yours<br />
Everyone repair, no excuses because you're not poor<br />
We must use warriors plated from the knees up<br />
to please taunt every single shadow debuff<br />
In WoW, we trust, Ebonroc will drop some neat stuff<br />
to suck all of your DKP up<br />
So MT, put your back to the wall<br />
Before he puts a crack in your jaw, when wing buffet happens you need to be fast with the call<br />
Everyone who's playing bad with a flaw<br />
Your occupation is slaying dragons and all, not practicing law<br />
So be professional, this boss is the biggest of jokes<br />
And the strategy's fine, we ain't gonna fix what ain't broke<br />
Ebonroc is easy but before you think it's a hoax<br />
there's a rogue down, why? he ain't wearin' his Onyxia cloak<br />
So keep the Mortal Strike on him<br />
Warriors might taunt him? Nah, do it right before I make it my problem<br />
5 percent, dps til he's reduced to nada<br />
Loot the gold, that's enough to buy you out some gucci prada<br />
There's a mage afk, so I'm gonna boot him outta<br />
the raid to go to Flamegor, a.k.a. The Loot Pinata</p>
<p>Flamegor - (Snoop Dogg Impersonation)<br />
now when we step in the corner, it's real breezy<br />
Blizzard made Flamegor to be too easy<br />
We need a pally that can stay ooc<br />
so he can rez shaun dogg<br />
every dps in for the onslaught<br />
I'mma just watch cuz I'm a pimp, call me Shaun Dogg<br />
Tanks gotta taunt the wing buffet<br />
Then we can get ourselves a chicken wing buffet<br />
Or is it wing buffet, put the plates away<br />
cuz y'all smooth cats can't be afk<br />
and y'all zoom out, this ain't a fps<br />
Need the dps with the hps<br />
y'all healing cats, check the LoS<br />
So use that LoH, and the NS<br />
if the main dude starts droppin' HP<br />
Top him off using all up that MP<br />
single target damage, no AoE<br />
just instant attacks and some DoT's<br />
you can front like a balla in RP<br />
Or PvP to PvE<br />
But y'all cats need to listen up tho<br />
Cuz if you be pullin' a g g r o<br />
run to flamegor, or it won't be funny<br />
Gotta take him down so we can make that money<br />
So y'all hunter cats, bust a tranq cap<br />
Loot that gold to make the guild bank phat<br />
celebrate, like what the hell<br />
pass that bread and the roasted quail<br />
we ain't sippin on the gin n juice y'all<br />
naw, we sippin' on da thunderbrew dawg</p>
<p>yayuh, that's how a pimp do it...</p>
<p>Chromaggus - (Jurassic 5 Impersonation)</p>
<p>This one's a big dog, have you heard of him man?<br />
I heard you gotta tank him facing down the circular ramp<br />
He looks nasty, make you blow a turd in your pants<br />
But we gotta down Chromaggus, cuz we yearn to advance<br />
I'm a knight like Lancelot, exotic like Bangkok<br />
sword and shield armed, with a rifle that's hand-cocked<br />
So before this damn dog chews through me like ham hocks<br />
Every hunter gotta shoot him with tranq shots<br />
Hold the DPS, wait for first breath<br />
Healers LoS me when I take the first step<br />
Incinerate, but it ain't gonna hurt yet<br />
Wait for next breath, then we'll pass the verdict<br />
Perfect, it's frost breath, DPS in<br />
Run in, Run out, repeat it again<br />
I'm bleeding my friend, please make the healing ascend<br />
Watch the seconds rogues, y'all best be leaving at 10<br />
If you die, don't run, you'll encounter a locked door<br />
Just sit tight and play around with a mock sword<br />
Druids pass the innervates if you got more<br />
mana, then you need to be decursing the top floor<br />
Do it clean with the encores<br />
and our repair bill gon be cheaper than a Counterstrike awp !@!#&<br />
Chromaggus down, someone check if he dropped hoards<br />
of loot that would make every one of us flock towards<br />
Take the gold, stash that in the sock drawer<br />
Pull my broadsword blacksmithed from a hot forge<br />
Nefarian is the number one boss for<br />
This instance, and we're making the top score</p>
<p>Hook:<br />
He's C, H, R, O, M, A, double G, U, S<br />
You gotta be the best ever yet<br />
If you want to beat him, you're gonna catch wreck<br />
Put on a kevlar vest, this dog will set you to the test</p>
<p>Nefarian - (NYC Gangsta-ish)</p>
<p>Readied up in front of Nefarius with a Big Crew<br />
40 main raid turned into split groups<br />
20-man part moved into tight form<br />
Warriors plugging up left and right doors<br />
Locks set up blood pact, all because that<br />
We need the buff, hunters move, set up frost traps<br />
Lemme lay down some ground rules, keep your eyes glued<br />
Even heal the even, Odd heal the odd groups<br />
Ready up the swords, shields, staves, and guns y'all<br />
Nefarius said the game has begun y'all<br />
Y'all dps follow this system<br />
Each side has a main rogue, just assist him<br />
Popping off shots with an automatic burst<br />
Colors 2nd, we finna dead chromatics first<br />
If it's green, no problem<br />
If it's blue, every single caster move away from the bottom<br />
If it's bronze y'all, that's just a joke too<br />
Intercept that, a chromatic just broke through<br />
Don't get too cozy, yo matta fact<br />
Paladins turn on FR, for red and black<br />
MT get ready for the take down<br />
How many drakonids dead? 38 count<br />
Nefarian lands, here we go to phase 2<br />
MT back to the wall, you betta have him face you<br />
Finish both gates off or we might die<br />
When we done, casters stack on the right side<br />
Cut him down, buckin' shots till you're empty<br />
Dwarf Priests, fear ward on the mt<br />
Everyone stand by for the class call<br />
Paladin phase, dps take your hands off<br />
Let it run out, druids get them hots up<br />
Priests if you heal during your call, you'll get locked up<br />
You'll put the wrong dots up, Sit in the back row<br />
Hunter class call, use deequip macros<br />
DPS go, drop him real fast<br />
make him feel that, buckin' shots from mah steel gat<br />
Druid class call got us on the reverse<br />
I'mma say 3 words, mages please decurse<br />
Warrior call, don't make start me cursin' man<br />
Every overheal now, MT's in berserker stance<br />
Mage call got me nervous with a tense grip<br />
Every healer in the raid group gotta cleanse it<br />
druids gotta mend swift, when the tank's hurtin<br />
Rogue Class Call, MT gotta turn him<br />
Swerve him, Hurt him, now and it's payday<br />
Warlock Call, drop infernals with the melee<br />
20% percent health, Nef will take a clean death<br />
Zerg incoming, caster stack gotta reset<br />
Every warrior gotta keep it real y'all<br />
Stand with the caster stack, keep the spread real small<br />
Challenging Shout the zerg with a Shield Wall<br />
Cuz they'll run to the stack from the heals y'all<br />
Zerg over, spam with an execute<br />
Damn don't forget it dude, hand in the better loot<br />
Hang Nef in Stormwind when we run out<br />
BWL Clear, the instance is done now
</p>
