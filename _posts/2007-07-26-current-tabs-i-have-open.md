<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> - I never close this tab... ever. I swear it's javascript running 24 hours a day could fill an ocean of memory leaks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.iStockPhoto.com">iStockPhoto</a> - building some graphics for SugarLoot</li>
<li><a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> - Another tab I use a lot along with more javascript memory leaks.</li>
<li>SugarLoot Admin page - updating contests</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com">This Blog</a> - writing this post and kept open for quick link posting.</li>
<li>Obligatory Random Article - Always have at lest one open. This time it's <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/15-07/local#8">Bruce Sterling's Dispatches From the Hyperlocal Future</a>. Hard not think of Harvey Feldspar as <a href="http://www.kottke.org">Jason Kottke</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.writely.com">Writely (currently google docs)</a> - I'm definitely a google whore but in my defense I still think of it as Writely. My <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> book from 2 years ago is open which I frequently open and pretend like I'm going to write more. I only have 6k words and most of it is notes. I'm not doing very well there.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sugarloot.com">SugarLoot</a> - viewing my changes from the admin page.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> - Spell checking words that I've spelled bad enough to baffle FireFox's spell check which I don't consider very strong. Google's algorithm can help me spell anything though.</li>
</ol>
