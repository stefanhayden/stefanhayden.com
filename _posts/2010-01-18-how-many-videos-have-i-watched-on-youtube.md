This is just a fun question that you used to be able to easily answer on youtube. But it seems some time in Nov 09 <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=7ee68d76002010a9&hl=en">it was removed</a>.  but while it seems to be gone there still seems to be <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=13bd4b9a458c8781&hl=en">a way to access the number for the time being</a>. 
<ol>	
<li> go here: <strong>http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/USERNAME?v=2</strong> and replace USERNAME with your username</li>
	<li>Search for <strong>videoWatchCount</strong></li>


</ol>

kind of a pain but hopefully that data will stay in the feed. We know google is tracking us all very closely. we might as well have access to that data.
