<p><a href="http://secure.blindferret.com/PvP/">PvP, one of the top online comics, is coming out with it's own animated shorts</a>. Season 1 will come out once a month and be 4 - 6 minutes each. I just <a href="https://secure.blindferret.com/PvP/signup.php">purchased mine and you should do that same</a>.</p>
<p>I'm excited about this for a number of reasons. Though I stopped following PvP I've always been a fan and I've always thought it would work better animated.</p>
<p>One of the best part of this in my opinion is that the PvP series has not been fully produced yet but is funning it self though pre-orders. While this might sound risky to people new to PvP I am not worried at all.</p>
<p>PvP has maintained high quality for years and I know Scott will bring that through to the new animated series. I've been saying <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/">Joss Whedon</a> should do this for years. I'd give Joss $50 or $60 to produce any TV show he likes and <a href="http://www.yalit.com">Keri</a> would do the same for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0031976/">Judd Apatow</a>. I truly hope PvP issues in a new era in entertainment production.</p>
