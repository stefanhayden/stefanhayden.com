I don't really have much to say about Obama. Some are angry and some are happy. The things I find interesting is the disconnect that seems to exist between what people seem to think the Nobel Peace Prize is and what they say they are.

It seem most people think of the sciences when it comes to the prize. Einstein figured out how the universe worked and then got a prize. He did something big and got an award. But that's not how the the Nobel Prizes say they work. they say that they have always given prizes to people who have done good work or to people who are in a position to do good work and show promise. Until now I don't think anyone has cared enough about the piece prize. But currently people are acutely aware of what Obama has done in his under a year in office.

Either way I think Obama handled it well. He's humbled and hopes to do great work. I couldn't agree more.
