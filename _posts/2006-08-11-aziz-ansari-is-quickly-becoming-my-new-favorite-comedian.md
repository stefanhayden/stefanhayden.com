<span id="vidDescRemain" style="display: inline"><a href="http://www.azizisbored.com/">Aziz Ansari</a>  is quickly becoming my new favorite comedian. I originally saw his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4xTZUoyCQ&mode=related&search=">Indie Clerk Assholes</a> video and now after seeing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6bI7ziGPk&mode=related&search=">Clell Tickle: Indie Marketing Guru</a> I've become hooked. Here is a great <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcgvGqo_OUI&NR">clip of some of his stand up</a>  where he has imaginary conversations with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mia">M.I.A.</a>   (<a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/2005/03/18/mia-maya-arulpragasam/">previously</a>). He plays up being a hipster a lot with lots of indy rock references but I still feel he has some wide appeal. If <a href="http://www.demetrimartin.com/">Demetri Martin</a>    can break though so can Aziz.</span>
