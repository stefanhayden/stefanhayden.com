<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0765315238/stefanhayden-20">The last Terry Goodkind book comes out November 13th</a>. I've been reading this series for about six years and and have slowly gotten sick of everything in the books besides the main plot line which I must follow to conclusion or the lack of closure will kill me. Here's hoping he just ends it. He's already threaten to write other books set in the same world. My stomach turns at the thought of it.
