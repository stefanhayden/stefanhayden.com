<a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> was amazing and every one I meet there was not only interesting and friendly but passionate and motivated. I think the atmosphere was really different from other conferences I have gone too mostly because people seem to be activly looking for people to work with and bounce ideas off of.

The <a href="http://startupschool.infogami.com/">Startup Wiki</a> really seems to have taken off and I hope to be able to reconnect with all the people I meet and continue to keep in touch. Hopefully a real community will build up around the wiki. Though I think we really need a more general community site. I was thinking of building something with <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a> but perhaps I will bunch the idea off a few people to see if there would be interest.
