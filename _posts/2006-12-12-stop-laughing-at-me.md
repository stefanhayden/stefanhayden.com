<p>Every once in a while a movie trailer pulls the wool over my eyes. The last time that happened it was <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0263757/">Uptown Girls</a> (I can wait for the laughter to stop). When I saw the preview I was expecting a funny, cute and genuine movie much like the movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0412922/">Little Manhattan</a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/little_manhattan/large.html">Trailer</a>).
