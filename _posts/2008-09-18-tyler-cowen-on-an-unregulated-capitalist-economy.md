More and more I find it fascinating how <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/09/sarah-palin-on.html">world views can keep your from talking about something in a way that makes sense</a>. It can be so hard to see through your own biases.

<blockquote>Republicans have no good language for discussing recent events.  They're not allowed to say anything that sounds like "showing sympathy for Wall Street," so they have to find someone else to show sympathy for but they can't turn to traditional Democratic rhetoric about how an unregulated capitalist economy is failing us.</blockquote>
