<p>All and all I don't think this is that great a video. The song isn't that great and if you don't know a reference it seems like it would be fairly hard to track down. I do think it is important to note that recently a lot more lists of internet fads have been popping up.</p>
<p>Things on the internet move so quickly and leave just as fast. I often worry if people are taking the time to properly document what is happening before it disappears forever.</p>
