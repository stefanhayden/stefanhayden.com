<p><a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/05/why_cant_television_do_college.html">Why can't television do college?</a> I'd love to know the answer to that. <a href="http://www.yalit.com">Keri</a> often complains there really isn't even a book market for books about college life. I'm starting to think an hour long drama from HBO or Showtime is needed to properly cover the complicated narrative that could evolve with so many students interacting with each other.
