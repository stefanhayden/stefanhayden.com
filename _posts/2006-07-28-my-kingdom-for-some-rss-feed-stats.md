Well it took a while for me to really sit down and notice (Okay..<a rel="external nofollow" href="http://syntheticrabbit.com/blog/">Trey</a> pointed it out) but I'm really pissed at Feedburner and wordpress. There just does not seem to be a good way to keep control of you're readers and still offer all the wordpress feeds.

My ideal set up is that every one subscribes to the default wordpress rss feed and then I redirect them with some server magic. Then if feedburner sucks or something better come along I can just redirect them else where. In addition I still want the comment feeds to work as well.

Wordpress had support for feeds for each comment thread but since the same file serves both the comment feed and the main feed you can't just send all the traffic to feedburner since they only server the main feed.

There seems no good way to track stats on the feed and keep the full functionality working.

Some one really needs to come up with a stat program for feeds. Either some code I can install or anything that will give me stats as well as the full functionality of wordpress rss.

<strong>Update:</strong> Matt Shobe from Feedburner kicked my ass in the comments below and showed me exactly what I wanted. It's really hard to no like a company when they fix all your problems. Thanks Matt!
