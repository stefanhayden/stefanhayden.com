<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0765352877/stefanhayden-20">EarthSeed</a> by Pamela Sargent in junior high and loved it so much I wanted to steal it from the library. Instead I put in a request with amazon and 6 months later they found a copy for me (it was way out of print). Now for some odd reason it's turning in to a trilogy. So I'm re-reading it, and I never re-read, so I can finish this supposed trilogy. Follow what I'm reading at my <a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/what-to-read/">What To Read list >></a>
