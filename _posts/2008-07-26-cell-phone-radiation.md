It's official I'm totally freaking out about <a href="http://ct.buzzfeed.com/rd?c=buzzfeed&ca=cell-phone-radiation&s=feed&d=0x0&p=0&ok=default&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fblanca%2Fcell-phone-radiation">Cell Phone Radiation</a>. I guess that I spend about 16 hours day with a cellphone in my pocket which is probably a solid dose of radiation everyday.

My plan is just take it out and place it on the desk at work and at home. That will easily knock out 10 to 14 hours a day. I could also put it in my backpack when i travel but I really like having my cellphone on silent 24/7 and I need to either hear it vibrate or feel it to make that work.
