<p>Choice quote from <a href="http://arincrumley.com/">Arin Crumley</a>:</p>
<div style="font-size:150%;"><p>"I'm very curious why someone feels they know us well enough to need to know if we are still together but not well enough to be able to deduce with out asking why it might be that we aren't. That is if we aren't." (<a href="http://arincrumley.com/post/15878170">link</a>)</p>
