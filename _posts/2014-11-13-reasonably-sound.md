Awhile ago I was listening to a podcast about video games. They focus mostly on console games but for whatever reason they were talking about PC games which is where most of my interest lie and they just said obviously wrong thing after obviously wrong thing. And it made me so angry. So angry that I actually just stopped listening to all of the small handful of podcasts I was subscribed to.

Slowly I am bringing them back. First to catch up with <a href="http://commonplacebooks.com/">Welcome to Nightvale</a> and then <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> which has swept the internet almost as quickly as Nightvale did. But also <a href="http://www.infiniteguest.org/reasonably-sound/">Reasonably Sound</a> a great podcast about an area I know very little about.

For me the greatest problem is just that podcasts are something I tend to do on my commute and which is also where I do most of my reading and so they tend to take me from reading. I'm already not reading as much as I should as I let Game of Thrones slow me down to a halt.
