<a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyers</a> came by Boston today and gave a talk on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> similar to what he talked about at <a href="http://odeo.com/audio/270417/view">Web Essentials 05</a>. It was much more informative with the slides in front of my face as opposed to just the podcast. While the ideas and concepts were nothing new to me it was good to have it reiterated and pounded in to my head. As much as I know about semantic mark up I constantly find my self making common mistakes.

While I love my laptop that <a href="http://www.sconex.com">Sconex</a> got me I don't know how good the wireless card is that is built in. It found the wireless network in the MIT building but couldn't connect. All well, no live blogging for me. I'll have to play with my wireless dongle and see if that works any better.
