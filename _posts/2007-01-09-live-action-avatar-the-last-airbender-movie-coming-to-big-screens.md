<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070109/film_nm/shyamalan_dc_1"><strong>Live action</strong> Avatar: The Last Airbender movie coming to big screens</a>. M. Night Shyamalan is at the helm as writer, directer and producer. I suppose it could be good but really why live action? I can't say I'm too hopeful.
