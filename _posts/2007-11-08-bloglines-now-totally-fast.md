Wow. Okay so <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#149">bloglines has updated their beta and it does seem really fast</a>. At this point the difference between google and bloglines is really just small interface differences. which interface do I like better? I have no idea. I left bloglines awhile go and now I'm considering possibly switching back.

Over the next couple of week I think I'm going to be using both and see which I settle on. I left bloglines really frustrated that their interface was too slow and painful to use. But they might have finally one upped google and I'd be excited to see them gain back some of the respect they once had.
