I was looking for a good address book and didn't really come across anything, especially for the PC. Searching more what I did find was the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/">Apple Address Book and the vCard standard</a> for the MAC and very simple Address book for the PC. From there the only good program I seemed to find was <a href="http://www.xeletrix.com/abook/">A-Book</a> which seems really nice though it is $30 for the full version and the trial is a timed 30 day trial. The v<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">Card wikipedia post</a> was lacking in much information as well.

I found a <a href="http://vcard.mozdev.org/index.html">Mozilla project for a vCard extension</a> but it seems to have been mostly abandoned. I think it would be a great extension to run right along side the Mozilla Calendar extension (as well as the standalone sunbird).

With <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/foo.html">iCalendar</a> starting to do some really interesting things on the internet with the ability to subscribe and publish online and <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hReview">hReview</a> looking to do some cool things in the near future I really want something to happen with vCard.
