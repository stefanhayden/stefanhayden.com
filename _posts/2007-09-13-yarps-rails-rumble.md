<p>After a long weekend of designing a website for the <a href="http://www.railsrumble.com">48 hour Rails Rumble</a> competition we are pleased with our end result. <a href="http://vote.railsrumble.com/teams/yarps/visit">Yarps</a> are little avatar pets that you can punish or praise. </p>
<p>Voting is open and though you do have to register to vote <a href="http://vote.railsrumble.com/teams/yarps/visit">I would greatly appreciate your vote</a>. There is some stiff competition but with some help I'm hoping we can get a respectable place.</p>
