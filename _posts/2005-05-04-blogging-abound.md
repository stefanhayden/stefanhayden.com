A blogging milestone happened in the art department today as I helped Jen, Katie, Christina, and even Mattyo <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?sthayden">setup a wordpress blog through Dreamhost</a> as you can see from the right side links bar. If this community of <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~artmain">TCNJ</a> blogging stays active it will be a great resource for both current and future art graduates from TCNJ.

Blogging will only get bigger and hopefully this will be the first step toward a very vibrant and living community at TCNJ that I hope to cultivate and build.
