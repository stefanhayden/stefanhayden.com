<p>Here's a choice quote from Dave Shea at SXSW:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I don't like looking at web pages in print”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm so glad that Dave has such a high brow view of print design. If you like to learn more you can read his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321303474/stefanhayden-20">The Zen of CSS Design: Visual Enlightenment for the Web</a> where <strong>every single page has a website on it</strong>.</p>
<p>While Dave Shea is above looking at websites in a book he's not above trying to sell them to the masses. I'm so glad I bought his book now. I want a refund.
