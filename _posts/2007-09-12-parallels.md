I'm not a Apple fan but some of the <a href="http://feeds.downloadsquad.com/~r/weblogsinc/downloadsquad/~3/155595291/">innovation that Parallels have been able to accomplish</a> on the Intel macs are really amazing. Honestly there are very few MAC programs I would want but I would appreciate a Parallels for windows. I doubt there is really a market for it.
