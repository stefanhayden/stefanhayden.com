Today is my last day at Shutterstock. I’ve been here for nine years but when an ethical dispute remains unaddressed and I have the privilege of being able to move on and I am proud to.

I know two others who are also leaving Shutterstock for the same reason. More are looking to leave and even more wish to leave but don’t think they will be able to.

Shutterstock is typically good at answering questions at company updates but in this instance my questions were deemed not appropriate.

I helped organize a petition that almost 20% of the company signed but zero changes were made.

Many have tried hard to find compromises and middle ground in an effort to make peace with the censorship we now participate in but zero changes have been entertained.

I wish I didn’t feel like I had to leave but I never want to work where I can’t fully get behind the company. I wish my coworkers the best of luck in their struggle to change how the company thinks about censorship.

I’m super proud of all the work I did at Shutterstock from growing Bigstock to building a powerful design tool in Editor. As well as all the work I have done to building culture with my coworkers. It was an amazing journey.
