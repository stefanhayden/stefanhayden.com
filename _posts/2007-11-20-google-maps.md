<a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/edit/promo.html">Google adds social editing of the map markers</a> so you can show the actual location of an address. Does not seem to factor in to map data yet. Personally I hope they add more social elements in as many people are extreme experts on their local area and have lot of map data to share.
