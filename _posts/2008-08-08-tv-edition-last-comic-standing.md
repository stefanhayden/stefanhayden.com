I plan on trying to document my TV viewing more.. mostly cause I'm starting to forget what the hell I've been watching.

I'm so happy that <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ilizawithani">Iliza Shlesinger</a> won last comic standing. Women comics have a bad rap and it goes to the core where a lot of comics don't think women are funny either. Not only has she risen above the fray she won because she was picked on and got to preformed 2 amazing sets while every one else sat in the back room. Poor choice fellas.

also check Iliza out on <a href="http://www.thestream.tv/series.php?s=16">The Weakly News</a>

P.S. Get a new host LCS. Really.
