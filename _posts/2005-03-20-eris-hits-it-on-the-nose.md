It was <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/sxsw-2005">Mike</a> who best talked about how, “The web community gets along remarkably well in person.” And really sold me on going to <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/">sxsw</a> and even made <a href="http://www.greendayfreaks.com/blog/">Matt</a> start planning his flights and hotel reservations. <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/sxsw-2005">Mike</a> hit it out of the park making <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/">sxsw</a> sound like the most exiting place on earth and didn’t really think anyone could make it sound any better.

Not surprisingly <a href="http://www.erisfree.com/updates/87/sxswi2005-attempted-wrap-up">Eris brought another dimension to it</a>, something that was mentioned everywhere but never said flat out. It’s the camaraderie is evident everywhere and I seems best summed up in an exchange between <a href="http://www.erisfree.com">Eris</a> and <a href="http://www.benbrown.com/">Ben Brown</a> that ended with, “Well here, hold on…..[as he pulls out two books and hands them to me] ....enjoy.”

It seem that sxsw is really the place where you realize that these blogs are people. You can just give away books because Eris is at <a href="http://www.erisfree.com">Erisfree.com</a> and she’s not going anywhere. If she never mails the book back you know exactly where to find her and ask for the book back. 

This is more then a web design community but more of a small town mentality reminiscent of my current obsession, <a href="http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,%7C%7C159,00.html">Gilmore Girls</a>, though I still making my way through the season one dvd. Every one knows everyone’s name, word travels fast about anything, and people feel fine lending things out.
