Nickelodeon is still trying to find way to make the DVD volumes of Avatar more interesting then the final collected box set for the seasons. I think the <a href="http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/index.php#475">comics in the season 3 set might do it</a>. I want those comic books but I really don't want to buy anything else but the final box set. I'm so conflicted.
