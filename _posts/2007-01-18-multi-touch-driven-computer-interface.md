<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/3dinterface.jpg" width="200" style="float:right;" />In movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">Minority Report</a> usability experts always laugh as people use 3D interfaces to use a computer. 3D interfaces don't make sense they will say.</p>
<p>But as we start to make leaps in interface design we seem to be moving more toward gesturing to interface with applications.</p>
<p> The iPhone is a small example but <a href="http://fastcompany.com/video/general/perceptivepixel.html">this video shows a huge screen with an interface of only gestures (Video: you have to wait through a commercial)</a>. Is this just a technology demonstration or real world applications? I certainly can't tell.
