It was recently reported that for the first time in history, <a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/07/05/297-the-south-shall-snack-again/">there are now more overweight than malnourished people in the world</a>. Umm... good? This idea just seems so odd to me. Like we are force feeding people in africa with twinkines or something.
