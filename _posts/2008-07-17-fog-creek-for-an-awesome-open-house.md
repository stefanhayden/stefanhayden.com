<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/07/14.html">Thanks to Joel and every one at Fog Creek for an awesome open house</a>. It's clear why they are so well respected as each member of Fog Creek was extremely friendly, Joel in particular. Definitely the best hosted meetup I've been to in a long time.
