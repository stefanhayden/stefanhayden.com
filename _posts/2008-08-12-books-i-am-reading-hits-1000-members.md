<a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com">Books I Am Reading</a> is tiny site I created to experiment with design and <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com/stefanhayden">track my reading</a>. With small sites come small mile stones and I'm very excited to have my <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com/1282384764">1,000th account created</a>.

The community is still very small. Only about 25% of accounts created have added a book. And only 10% have added several books. I've talked to several passionate users but I would guess there are no more then 20 or 30 users who use it as a way to truly track their reading.

But for a small web site with many bugs still present this is extremely gratifying.
