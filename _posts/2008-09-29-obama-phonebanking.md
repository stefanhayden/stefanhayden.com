I've been hesitant about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F1hYHnFnUk">calling people for Obama</a>. Currently my dislike of calling people is out weighing my want of Obama to be president. How sad is that? Any way here is a good 101 video of how to phonebank for Obama. I still need more encouragement but it's a start.
