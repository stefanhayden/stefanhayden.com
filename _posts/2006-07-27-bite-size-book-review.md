Hope it helps.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0060721960/stefanhayden-20">Predatorâ€™s Gold (The Hungry City Chronicles)</a>
This book really made me fully fall in love with the Hungry City Chronicles. I can't get enough. The characters have such strong motivation for whatever they do. So of the logic about how the cities roll around can be hard to buy but the ideas is just too much fun for me to get bogged down in the details.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0440418569/stefanhayden-20">The Amber Spyglass</a>
I was actually disappointed in how the trilogy ended. I was much happier in the first book.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0064471837/stefanhayden-20">Sabriel (The Abhorsen Trilogy)</a>
A solid unique book. some of the turns of phrases seemed a bit awkward and the characters just didn't really grab me as much. I still enjoyed it and will definitely get around to reading the others in the future.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0060826355/stefanhayden-20">Infernal Devices (The Hungry City Chronicles)</a>
This series can't really go wrong in my book. I love it so much. It continues to surprise and bring strong character driven plot. I've order the net book strait from the UK. I can't wait.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0765312786/stefanhayden-20">Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town</a>
Not as good as Down and out in the Magic Kingdom but still a good book. I got a bit confused by how the time line jumped at a few placesbut it didn't stop me from liking the book.
