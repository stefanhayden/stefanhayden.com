For any interested I'm going to be doing a series of Boston podcast reviews over at the <a href="http://www.bostonist.com/">Bostonist.</a> After moving up to boston and being O so bored for the first week or so I feel confident that I am a podcast expert. With podcasting being so new there is a real lack of reviews. While ranking systems at  <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com/">Podcast Alley</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>, and our lovable friends over at <a href="http://odeo.com">Odeo</a> help they can't be the only way to find good new content.
