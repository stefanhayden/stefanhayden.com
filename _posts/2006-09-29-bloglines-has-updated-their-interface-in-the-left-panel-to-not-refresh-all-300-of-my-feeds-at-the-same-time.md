<p>Big day for feed readers. <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#122">Bloglines has updated their interface in the left panel to not refresh all 300 of my feeds at the same time</a>. This refresh was literally bringing Firefox to a halt and is a welcome update. Bloglines is clearly fighting to keep me off of Google's reader.
