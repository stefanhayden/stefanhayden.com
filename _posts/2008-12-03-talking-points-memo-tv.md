If youre insterested in the news but are too lazy to read anything other then link agregators then TPMtv is an amazing resorce. Thier day of news in a 100 seconds is the best news cast in the world.

This <a href="http://youtube.com/?v=yaZtIu34fgU">Best Of... 2008 Presidential Primaries</a> is pretty amazing as well.
