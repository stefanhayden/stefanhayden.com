I've been a <a href="http://jetsetshow.com/">JetSet</a> fan for a while now (in internet time at least) and I hate when I miss the obvious. JetSet is part of a larger network of shows called Next New Networks.

<a href="http://nextnewnetworks.com">Next New Networks</a> is yet another IPTV network that have been popping up all over the place. The fact that I did not already know they existed just goes to show I don't read <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/newteevee/~3/162349250/">NewTeeVee</a> as much as I really should.

There a ton of really well produced shows on that network. Not all are my cup of tea but it has been a long time since I've found a network with more then one show that I like.

Beyond JetSet I've also become a fan of <a href="http://www.viropop.com/">ViroPop with their ZapRoot</a> show about environmentalism and <a href="http://pulpsecret.com/">PulpSecret</a> about comics. I was really excited about <a href="http://www.totalmmo.com/">Total MMO</a> but it's in a odd format that doesn't interest me. I rather have human hosts talking about ideas and issues with MMOs. But I'm picky as I've been looking for good commentary since the golden years of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lum_the_Mad">Lum The Mad</a>. <a href="http://www.threadbanger.com/">ThreadBanger</a> for indy fashion designers was also a fun watch but not really up my alley. 

I think the thing I really love about Next New Networks is how awesomely niche and focused these shows are around really active communities. Such active communities ends up making richer shows. I know Zadi from JetSet has been doing an amazing job of bringing users into the show and it really heightens the interest in the show.
