The idea of an entire movie told from one point of view (like a hand held camera) sounds like a cool idea if they can pull it off. I have no idea if <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX8cpgLkj7U">CLOVERFIELD (video)</a> can do it. But The Scramble Network have some pretty good incite in to what the movie might really be about and it <a href="http://www.scramblenetwork.com/?p=428#more-428">sounds like yet another exciting possibility (spoiler if you believe what they say)</a>.
