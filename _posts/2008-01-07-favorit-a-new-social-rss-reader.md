I'm a total RSS reader nerd. <a href="http://fav.or.it">Fav.or.it</a> is a new RSS reader that looks like it is doing some really interesting things. Internally ranking posts by length of articles (sounds biased toward long posts). Integrating posts comments along with the ability to post directly to the blog. Even trying to take the focus away from individual blogs and more on quality content.

I'm so sad it's in private beta as I would love to try thing out. I don't think it's amazing enough to make me leave google reader but it's the first time I've been excited about an RSS reader in a long time.
