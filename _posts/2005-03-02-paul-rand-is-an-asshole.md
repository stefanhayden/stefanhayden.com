As you go through school as a design major you have your teachers talk about the great designers. I definitely don’t know enough about past designers and my digital concentration took the graphic design history class and instead gave me a 2 part digital senior seminar.

My one teacher Fanky live and breaths Paul Rand, which is cool because he is a very historic figure and has some of the tightest design this side of the Atlantic ocean. But when I heard <a href="http://www.designweenie.com/blog/index.php/1307">this story about meeting Paul Rand</a> I almost felt a sign of relief. Sure he might be the greatest designer and I might pale in comparison. <a href="http://www.designweenie.com/blog/index.php/1307">But he’s an asshole</a>, and for the most part I'm a pritty nice guy.
