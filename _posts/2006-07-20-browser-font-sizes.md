Did you know that Firefox, Opera and possibly Safari have a minimum font size? I didn't.

It's easy to think of why you would want one. If I'm making a browser I don't want my users to come across a website with tiny font they can not read.

As a designer if I want a tiny font for whatever reason I should be able to choice one. IE give you the ability to choose any font size.

FireFox has it's default size at 10px and it can be found in Tools > Options... in the Content tab under the Font's & Colors' advanced tab.

No matter what you do in the CSS the font will not get smaller then 10px. If you don't know there is a minimum in place you can really get caught off guard as you become baffled that the CSS isn't doing what you want.

I really didn't think 9px font size was really that unreasonable.
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Firefox" title="Firefox" src="/wp-content/fontsize.jpg" /></div>
