<img align="left" title="NYPD spy cam" alt="NYPD spy cam" src="http://static.flickr.com/54/130876926_0d2504a839_t.jpg" />The NYPD are installing <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060416/ap_on_re_us/eyes_on_the_city">500 of these high tech surveillance unites</a>. Wasn't there a science fiction movie with those things? When do they start flying and shocking me every time I jaywalk? I can't wait to hear about the NYPD using them to see if there is a long line at the corner pizza shop or if the rumor about girls hiding bombs under their skirts is really true.

This is going to go horrible horribly wrong. (via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/04/17/nypd_installing_lots.html">BoingBoing</a>)
