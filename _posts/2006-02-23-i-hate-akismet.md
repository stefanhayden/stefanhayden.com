<a title="akismet" href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a> is really starting to piss me off. It's a great spam filter for <span id="misp_compose_2" class="hm">wordpress</span> and has really stopped all spam.It has also stopped all commenting. This is a tiny tiny blog in the midst of a vast blogosphere and get few to no comments at all. Every comment I get is like a small flower that I want to tend and encourage to grow.

<span id="misp_compose_4" class="hm">Akismet</span> insists on placing comments in the moderation queue and then never telling me. It sends me no email and I don't check often enough to see new comments. In general I would like actual comments to float right through to the page.

<span id="misp_compose_5" class="hm">Akismet</span> might be great at stopping spam but what's the point if it just stops everything else as well? It would be one thing if I could turn on email notification, or change the level of security but there are no options to mess around with.

Previously I was using spam karma. I don't know if that's been upgraded to <span id="misp_compose_8" class="hm">wordpress</span> 2.0 but I'm missing it <span id="misp_compose_9" class="hmd">a lot</span> these days.

<a title="founder of wordpress" href="http://photomatt.net">Matthew <span id="misp_compose_1" class="hm">Mullenweg</span></a> could comment about all the great think <span id="misp_compose_2" class="hm">Akismet</span> could do and all the improvements he will make but who knows if I'd ever even notice the post to approve it.
