Just finished watching the last four <a title="Arrested Development " href="http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/">Arrested Development</a> episodes and they were amazing. It has been a bittersweet year for the shows I love and watching The last episodes reminded me all to much of my heart break at the end of the <a title="Serenity" href="http://www.serenitymovie.com/">Serenity</a> movie. It's sad when you know things are coming to an even when there is so much story left to tell but it lets you never take a moment for granted. I miss the show already.
