3D TVs. guess what? I don't want one. The problem is people who make TVs need to come up with new ways to convince people to buy new TVs because that's the only way they can make more money.

So I thought I would just throw up my 2 cents on what would make me want to buy a new TV. Do you know where the current action seems to be going on? Set top boxes. Cable Boxes, x-box, Roku. That's the current battle ground. That's where I get added value.

If I made TVs I would be pissed that people felt the need to add a box to my TVs. Why not just build that shit right in to the TV? That's part of the reason I think GoogleTV is interesting. It will come installed on some TVs. With enough internet services all I need is a TV and Ethernet cord. Who knows what other software you could put on TVs. An apps market place? Inputs for game controllers? Camera for filming video or teleconferencing? What if the TV worked with TiVo to make Tivo even more awesome (even though I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/StefanHayden/status/16281102585">pissed at series 4 tivo</a>)? I feel like TVs are in a good place to undercut a lot of these boxes that people put under their TVs (BTW with flat screen TVs set-top-box doesn't even make sense any more).

And to be clear. I'm not buying a 3D TV. So build me something I would want to buy.
