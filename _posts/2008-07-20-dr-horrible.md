I have to say I wasn't wild about the end of <a href="http://www.drhorrible.com/">Dr Horrible</a>. I didn't dislike it. I just didn't like it as much as the first too parts. I think the songs were a little weaker which did not do a good job of highlighting the change to a sadder tone. I'm still buying the DVD though so I can't wait for that to come out.
