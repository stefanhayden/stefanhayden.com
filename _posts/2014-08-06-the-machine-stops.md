I read <a href="http://stefanhayden.com/The_Machine_Stops.html">The Machine Stops</a> in college and it took a while for me to really get it. It really nails the internet but the trick is it was written in 1909. Also since it's from 1909 it's out of copyright but there is no good version of it online so this is my <a href="http://stefanhayden.com/The_Machine_Stops.html">new version of it</a>.
