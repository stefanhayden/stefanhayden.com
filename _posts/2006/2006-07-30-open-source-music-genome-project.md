<!-- ckey="6F3F6FFE" -->Pandora is a great music service that does a great job of matching up artists and songs to your tastes. <a href="http://pandora.com/">Pandora</a> claims to have hundreds categories it calls "genes" in it's <a href="http://pandora.com/mgp.shtml">Music Gnome Project</a>.

These genes are a great way to delve deeper in to your own music tastes then you ever have before. Pandora keeps these categories under lock and key though and only shows a few of them for each song.

Though there are probably categories they never show it would great if there was place that showed all the categories they did show to the public.

With that wish I launch the <a href="http://osmgp.pbwiki.com/">Open Source Music Genome Project</a>. A project that will hopefully blossom into an awesome resource to people who want to better understand the music they are listening to.

Please visit the Open Source Music Genome Project wiki and help organize, add to, and develop a full list of categories and descriptions.

Below is what I have collected so far from Pandora. A small drop in the bucket of the hundreds of categories Pandora have behind the scenes.
