Movies to look out for:  <a title="Site: Latest Movie Trailers (http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/childrenofmen/)" href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/childrenofmen/">Children Of Men</a>,   <a title="Site: Latest Movie Trailers (http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/thefountain/trailer1/)" href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/thefountain/trailer1/">The Fountain</a>,   <a title="Site: Latest Movie Trailers (http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/theillusionist/trailer/)" href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/theillusionist/trailer/">The Illusionist</a>,   <a title="Site: Latest Movie Trailers (http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/americanhardcore/trailer/)" href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/americanhardcore/trailer/"> American Hardcore</a>,   <a title="Site: Latest Movie Trailers (http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/teenagemutantninjaturtles/)" href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/teenagemutantninjaturtles/"> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>,   <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/theprestige/">The Prestige</a>.   Okay. Some of these movies will probably be bad (you'll notice I didn't even list the Transformer movie) but I think they have a fighting chance.
