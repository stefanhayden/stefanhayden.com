<p>People are starting to make noise about Web 2.0 <a href="http://wisdump.com/web/top-10-web-20-losers/">winners</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71810-0.html">losers</a>. The lists are all really weird in my opinion. Does anyone even know if the "losers" are actually going bankrupt or if the "winners" are making any money? People are doing a bad job of defining what success and failure actually is.
