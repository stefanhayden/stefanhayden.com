<p><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/legaltechnology/pubArticleLT.jsp?id=1160730321685">An interesting article about a guy who switched to MAC and is now switching back</a>. Of course the <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2006/10/flame-my-birthday-present-to-me.html">MAC community is all</a> <a href="http://patrickhaney.com/thinktank/2006/10/15/larry-bodine-jackass">over this</a> picking on everything from his factual inaccuracies to his grammar.</p>
<p>Sure he was wrong about a lot of stuff he could not get his MAC to do but it's not really the point. The is, and will always be, that he knew how to use a PC and now he's back to square one with a MAC.</p>
<p>MACs are "easier" but MAC users forget how much easier it is to stick with windows which people already know. I mean there is better health care in Scandinavia but I don't see every one moving there. You'd have to learn a new language, new laws, a new town, get new friends.</p>
<p>Windows will be around for a long time simply because people know how to use it and very few people want to start over and relearn a new operating system.
