<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2006/07/31/hub_sets_citywide_wifi_plan/?page=1">Boston is working on a low cost city wide WiFi plan that lets companies compete for users dollar</a>. Low cost is currently undefined and could range from free to $15 a month which sounds worth it to me. In a city like Boston though you need to wonder if they can get the WiFi down in the subways. that would be a victory for everyone.
