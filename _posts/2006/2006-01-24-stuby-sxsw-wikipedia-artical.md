Two years ago was the first time I had heard of <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">South by South West</a> and last year was the first time I read every single blog that covered it. During SXSW it's easy to get lost in it all and feel like the entire blogosphere is there. This year is the first I'll be attending and while <a href="http://avalonstar.com/2006/01/24/the-avalonstar-meet-greet/">plans are being made</a> and <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/">panels forming up</a> I thought it would be a good idea to just double check and make sure I actually read every single website last year.

Jumping over to trusty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> to find out the best sxsw resources I was greeted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SXSW">saddest wikipedia article</a> I have ever seen. Why is the biggest and best web design conference accompanied by such a horrible entry? I have my theories. The SXSW web site is nothing to scoff at and it a great resource unto itself and there are any number of blogs that covered it minute by minute.

Many companies use the wikipedia entry as a marketing tool and that is something I'm sure SXSW can afford to over look. Either way this stub of an article is just depressing and the web designers of the world need to step up and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SXSW">finish this article</a>.
