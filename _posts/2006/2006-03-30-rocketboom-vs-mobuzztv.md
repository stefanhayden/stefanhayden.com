As hard as I might try I really can't get in to <a title="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/" href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/">Rocketboom</a>. I can't figure out why it's as popular as it is. It's not that I don't like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.amandacongdon.com/">Amanda Congdon</a> It's just that I don't find her sense of humor very endearing. Her enthusiasm seems fake and no matter what the news story is it always has some sort of cheese spin to it. I don't wish bad things upon them, I just don't get it.

On the other hand I love <a title="http://www.mobuzz.com" href="http://www.mobuzz.com">MoBuzzTV</a>. Karina Stenquist has the perfect personality for the online world. Smart, sarcastic and just a little snarky everyday the news is delivered with just the right amount of dark humor. In general I can't say enough great things about it besides I wish it was longer.

It makes me kind of annoyed that Rocketboom gets so much attention and yet MoBuzzTv seems so over looked. I can only hope they are doing well and will continue to produce shows for a lone time.
