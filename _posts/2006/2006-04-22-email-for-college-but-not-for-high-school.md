With <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> aggressively opening their new <a href="http://ideas.live.com/programPage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d">Live email</a> accounts to colleges, the war is on. It was only several months ago that <a href="https://www.google.com/hosted">google announced</a> that they were opening <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a> to colleges. The service they both offer is both slightly different but the interesting part id the push to get market share.

Giving email accounts to college students is a good way to get them to keep it forever. Google didn't seem like they were actively going after colleges to join their program but <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_Sends_Windows_Live_to_College/1145650063">Microsoft announced their service with 72 colleges </a>read to join.

While this seems like a good thing it also seems rather redundant. Most colleges offer an email address even if it is only for the 4 years you attend the college. High Schools on the other hand do not offer email as a rule and could benefit from services Microsoft and Google could offer. Being able to create school mailing lists and perhaps even class groups would be invaluable.
