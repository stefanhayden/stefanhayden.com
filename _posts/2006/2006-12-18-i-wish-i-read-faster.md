<p>I've Stopped reading Kate Elliot's new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0765310554/stefanhayden-20">Spirit Gate</a>. I read about half of the 7 books in the Crown of Stars series in high school. I really like the stories Kate Elliot has to tell. She really creates very full characters and realistic worlds. Her female characters are particularly strong and realistic in a genera where they are often used as props.</p>
<p>I just can't read it fast enough. I'm a slow reader and Kate writes dense books. Only getting through a couple of pages on the commute to work and back is just not satisfying enough. I wish it wasn't the case but I think I'm going to have to sadly give up on Kate Elliot.
