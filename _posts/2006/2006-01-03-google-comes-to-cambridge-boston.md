            <a href="http://www.sconex.com">Sconex</a> moved a couple of doors down the hall to an office twice the size of what we used to be in. Though we now have a small basketball court and a full time make shift ping pong table it still seems like we are going to fill the room up with people quickly.<br /><br />Just down the hall our tiny little old office has a shiny new <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a> sign on the door. <a href="http://www.cambridgeinnovationcenter.com/">CIC</a> is full of small start ups and I don't know any one who isn't excited to see google joining us in our small space. I'm not entirely sure who google will be moving in to that small space but the rumor is that it will be the mobile phone technology company <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#2005">google acquired recently</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.android.com/">Their website</a> has little information about what their technology is and I hope they don't mind showing some of it around the office a bit.<br /><br /><tags>google, boston, sconex, office, Android, mobilephone, cellphone,  cic, cambridge</tags>
