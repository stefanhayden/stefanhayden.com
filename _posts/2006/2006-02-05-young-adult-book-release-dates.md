Check out <a title="yalit" href="http://www.yalit.com">YALit</a> which is a site for young adult book release dates that I've been working on with Keri for a few weeks now. This obviously serves what I like to call a "super niche market" which is sad because I will not become world famous for building it and yet wonderful because this is a resource that is greatly needed by the young adult literature community.

How needed? After being listed in google for about a week we are already seeing tons of people organically finding the site. Not to mention that we've already been pick up as a resource on the <a title="YALibrarian blog" href="http://yalibrarian.com/lucid/index.php?Upcoming-Teen-Titles">YALibrarian blog</a>.

While having a simple one stop shop to find out what is coming out when is great I hope to also build a small community to help support the site. Book release dates are not distributed in any logical fashion and it will take a wider then we currently have to catch every single book release date.

I'd love to hear any <a title="email me" href="http://stefanhayden.com/blog/contact">questions or suggestions</a> you might have.
