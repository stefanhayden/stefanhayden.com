The current numbers for the amount of oil leaking in the gulf before June 3rd have just been <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/06/201061103511522686.html">updated to up to 40,000 barrels a day</a>. That's a large number but I really think it's hard to put in to perspective. 

A good way to put that in context is to compare it to the amount of oil the USA uses a day. The US Energy Information Administration says the USA <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_psup_dc_nus_mbblpd_a.htm">in 2009 used 18,686,000 barrels of oil a day</a> (<a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MTTUPUS2&f=A">chart</a>).

(18,686,000 / 24) / 60 =  12,976 barrels a minute

40,000 leaking barrels a day / 12,976 = 3.08 or 3 minutes and 4.8 seconds

So while that's a lot of oil, it's only a small fraction of the oil we use a day. Even over the whole 47 days between April 20th and June 6th only 2 hours and 25 minutes of oil were spilled.

I'm not saying that it's not a catastrophic disaster but every day we pollute by several magnitudes more and it's good to keep these things in perspective.
