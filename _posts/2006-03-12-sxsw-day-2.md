Sunday was very low key. Only a couple of sessions really stood out. <a title="meet judy jetson" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060010">Meet Judy Jetson</a> was interesting but not overly so. We still seemed to be so frighted of teens using technology that we can't get past it. Of the 3 one did mention sconex which was pretty cool even though it was just in passing.

The Keynote with <a title="Kottke" href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> and <a title="dooce" href="http://dooce.com/">Heather Armstrong</a> was good. I never got in to Dooce but I do like Kottke. I think it's funny that so many designers can agree on something like web standards but still can't accept pro blogging as something respectable. I meet Jason briefly at <a title="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/2005/09/18/aiga-discovery-the-internet/" href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/2005/09/18/aiga-discovery-the-internet/">AIGA</a> and he's a really nice guy.

In fact he's the opposite of what anyone might think. If you ever want to find Jason at a conference you just need to look for some one with a power book in the corner who is trying to disappear. I've never seen anyone who wanted to blend in to the background as much as Jason does. I could tell he was best on stage when he was talking to Heather and forgot about the audience.

If anything I like hearing over and over again the same thing at similar panels. I hope that when I start my own mew media company I might even do the right thing the first time around.

<a title="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060027" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060027">  Holistic Web Design</a> was by far the best presentation of the day. All of the members of the panel help completely redesign <a title="http://www.plazes.com/" href="http://www.plazes.com/">Plazes.com</a> and the results were amazing. I loved to hear each one talk about the project, what they changed, why and how it effects the end user. Eris Stassi (who abandoned her blog several months ago) really did an amazing job of directing the redesign and I have even more respect for her then I had in past years.
