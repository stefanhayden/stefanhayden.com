I had this idea several years ago that I should repost comments I make around the internet here. I think Kottke had started doing it though he mostly stopped. I never did it more then once but I certainly regret not doing it more. I would have liked to have had that history here.

Sites like Medium are all the rage now and I have not had much interest in posting there. For me when content feels more ephemeral I'm more willing to give it away and Medium feels just like blogging but without the content ownership.

Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr is where the conversation is happening and it feels like a conversation. Mostly short responses that are apart of a larger context. Posting them here wouldn't even make sense out of context and posting them here removes them from the conversation which is the only reason to post them in the first place.

Some parts of the internet, I think, are starting to encourage longer responses though. Idea Channel, like I just posted below, has build an amazing community partly due to youtube's longer comment length but also due to so many being called out in the last few minutes of the show.

When I look back on my childhood I can barely remember what I did or liked or watched and I kind of hate that. This site should be that log of what I did and liked. Lets see if I can once again start posting stuff here that is less for others and more for future me. Because I want future me to remember this stuff better then I am usually able to.
