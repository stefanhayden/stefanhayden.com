As of today <a href="http://www.sconex.com">Sconex.com</a> is officially dead. I designed and built user interfaces for Sconex for full year before moving on to <a href="http://www.sugarloot.com">Sugarloot</a>, which currently still resolves to an IP adress. 

Unlike most web designers who jump from project to project I tend to spend large amounts of time on a site and it's sad too see one go. Sconex had a lot of rough design edges but there was a lot of great work I put in there. I'm still happy with how you could make a quiz. It was simple and intuitive. And the front page was pretty hot too.

It usually good to keep your portfolio fresh though and I guess now's as good a time as any to trim mine down.
