The new <a href="http://re.search.wikia.com">wikia search is pretty cool</a>. With such a large Wikipedia community already in existence I wonder how long until the hand indexed search results are super useful. <a href="http://mahalo.com/">Mahalo</a> has a slightly different approach but has already executed really well and I have found it to be really useful. Fun watching a new niche emerge.
