One day I want to be cool and know what cons to go to before I just hear about it after the fact. I knew about ROFLcon long long ago and mostly wrote it off. I was clearly greatly mistaken and now the "golden years" are most likely over and next year will suck (I have yet to go to a con where "last year was better" isn't the number one thing people say). I'm so bitter I should move to Pennsylvania. 

What was I posting about? Oh yeah this <a href="http://www.tiara.org/papers/roflcon_talk.txt">talk about Internet Fame is an awesome critique of internet culture as a whole</a> as well as how celebrity has changed over the years. I love that it's all in a .txt file.

<blockquote>"I want to create a new taxonomy of modern internet fame. This is important because otherwise we end up lumping gothic fetish models and Michael Arrington in the same bucket. Which is gross."</blockquote>
