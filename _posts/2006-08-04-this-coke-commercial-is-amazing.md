<p><a href="http://www.itsartmag.com/news/archives/524-Amazing-New-PsyOp-commercial.html">This Coke commercial is amazing</a>. I'm a sucker for surrealism. The only thing I don't believe in that whole commercial is that the guy got a coke for a dime. Even outside of the coke headquarters in Atlanta it's fifty cents.
