There is a Lewis Black bit where he predicts the end of the world has already come because there is a Starbucks across the street from a Starbucks. I was walking down Harvard Ave over by Coolidge Corner and noticed another CVS just down the street from the giant CVS on the corner. How is this possible? I know CVS is all over the place and Coolidge Corner is a happening place but no one needs that many pharmacies by them. If I was expecting this unfortunate event from any store I was expecting it from Dunkin Donuts, a Boston based chain which just so happens to be on every corner.

You got to love Boston but it's still fun to poke at little inconsistencies.
