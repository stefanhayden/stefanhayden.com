I'm now putting <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com/">Books I Am Reading</a> in to Beta. I was going to try an attempt to do this with some fanfair but think I'll just go for a quiet beta. Hopfully everything goes well or I might just drop it back to Alpha.

Currently the site works well for my needs but I do know there is alot more stuff to add. Things like comments, reordering of lists and possibly some better way to keep track of friends are the directions I would like to go.
