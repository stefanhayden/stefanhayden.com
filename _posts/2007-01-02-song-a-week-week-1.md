<p>In an effort to keep my self looking for new music I want to share an MP3 with you each week for the next year.</p>
<p>Song 1: <a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/mp3/werefrombarcelona.mp3">We're From Barcelona (MP3)</a><br />
We're From Barcelona from the band I'm From Barcelona is just such a fun song I can't help from listening to it several times. They really do encompass a weird Indy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch">Kitsch</a> that come across really strongly in the music video below. I think only an Indy band can truly own these kind of postmodern jokes that would fall on deaf ears in the main stream.</p>
