As time goes on we'll get to look even more in to how the media's coverage of Hillary was sexist. Hopefully it can be researched enough that it might be better next time around. While I do think sexism was a problem and was horrified by the things many people said I don't think sexism was "the reason" she lost. This is a great overview of things you might not have even knew went on during the election.
