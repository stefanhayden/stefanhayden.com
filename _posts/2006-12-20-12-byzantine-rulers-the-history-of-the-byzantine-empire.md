<p><a href="http://www.anders.com/lectures/lars_brownworth/12_byzantine_rulers/">This podcast on the history of the Byzantine Empire is amazing</a> and that it is available free on the internet speaks well for the future. It focuses on 12 rules and effect on the empire.</p>
<p>The quality is amazing and the depth of information is incredible. For me it is a little dense and could have used a slightly slower pace so I could better absorb the information but other wise this is a college coarse in MP3 format. I feel I deserve credit just for listening to it.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in history or Byzantine, which I have both, you must give this project a listen.</p>
