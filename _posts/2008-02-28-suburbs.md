<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/subprime">Amazing article about the current state of the suburbs</a> and the zeitgeist that got them there. I mostly think Hackensack is safe from these effect as we have tons of public transportation to NY as well as a smallÂ  down town area that I hear has been trying to redevelop.
