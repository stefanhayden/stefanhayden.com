Not that I'm trying to keep up with Kottke but there are actually a good number of people blogging and there's not way I'm going to be able to read them all. Not getting home till 11:30 I blog for the benefit of AIGA which I hope to help drag it kicking and screaming in to the blogosphere.

I'd like to say high to all the folks from Kottke and <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/unbeige/">UnBeige</a> who have been doing much better coverage then I have. I suppose working the conference does have it's downsides. For other blogs present at AIGA look at this handy list:

<a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/unbeige/">UnBeige</a> actually has a number of great posts about the blog focus session (the only panel about the web) that included <a href="http://www.personism.com/">Jen Bekman</a>, <a href="www.designobserver.com">Michael Bierut</a>, <a href="http://www.kottke.org">Jason Kottke</a>, and <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/">Armin Vit</a>. I was sad that after the main stage presentation there was not much to do backstage but I was glad I got to go to the focus sessions.

I had a chance to meet Jason Kottke earlier in the day (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/09/lonely-in-a-packed-room">the lone laptop in the sea that is the main stage audience</a>). People have different strategies for meeting celebrities and mine is simple. Get in, say hi, compliment their past work, thank them and then move on. You don't want to be clingy. Jason doesn't need some groupie talking his ear off. You know.... just plant the seed of friendship and move on. Don't kill it with too much attention.

I was a little late to the blog session since I was running DJ Spooky, aka Paul Miller, around the convention center. I'm not a big fan of text messaging (at least not with my phone) but I let Paul text all he wanted since he was having a hard day. I was hoping by the title "To blog or not to blog: What's the question?" that it would have been more about encouraging the audience to blog, Instead it was more of a over view of what all four of them did. And even then  it was a brief overview and I wish they had deeper in to how blogging is changing things. I need to remember, baby steps for AIGA. It needs to learn what the internet is before it can figure out what blogging is. I don't know about all of the audience but a number of them did seem to have a good grasp of what was going on and tried to push the conversation deeper.

Today was very smooth backstage. The band upstairs knew what was going on and so did the sketch artist and the integration between them and intros and exits were wonderful. I was very relived to see everything working after the 1st day where everything just felt jerky. I don't know if it seemed that way out in the crowd but I doubt it. Everything always seems worse from backstage. It's just too easy to see the mistakes as they happen.
