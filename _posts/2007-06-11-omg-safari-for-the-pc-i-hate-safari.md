<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">OMG Safari for the PC</a>. I hate Safari. Besides that after seeing Firefox render differently on mac, pc, and linux and IE rendering differently everywhere I can't imaging safari will be pixel for pixel between the mac and pc. My god another illegitimate bastard browser to check up on.
