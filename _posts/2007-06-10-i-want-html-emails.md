<p>No matter hoe much people argue against html email I remain unconvinced. <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/06/08/e-mail-is-not-a-platform-for-design/">Zeldman's arguments remain unconvincing</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>E-mail was invented so people could quickly exchange text messages</p></blockquote>
<p>Wasn't that was the entire internet was originally for? The internet wasn't designed for streaming video, maybe we should stop doing that too?<br />
I like html emails and I'll bet there are tons of other who do as well. The internet is doing tons of things it was never designed to do, why should that stop email?</p>
