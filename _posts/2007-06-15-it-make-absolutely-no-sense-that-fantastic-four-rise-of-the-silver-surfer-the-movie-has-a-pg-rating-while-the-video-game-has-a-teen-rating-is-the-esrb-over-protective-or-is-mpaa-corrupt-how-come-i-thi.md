title: 'It make absolutely no sense that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer the movie has a PG rating while the video game has a Teen rating. Is the ESRB over protective or is MPAA corrupt? How come I think it&#8217;s both?'

<p>It make absolutely no sense that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four:_Rise_of_the_Silver_Surfer">the movie has a PG rating</a> while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four:_Rise_of_the_Silver_Surfer_(video_game)">the video game has a Teen rating</a>. Is the <a href="http://www.esrb.org">ESRB</a> over protective or is <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">MPAA</a> corrupt? How come I think it's both?
