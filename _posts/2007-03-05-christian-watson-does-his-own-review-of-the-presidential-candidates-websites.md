<p><a href="http://www.smileycat.com/miaow/archives/000605.html">Christian Watson does his own review of the presidential candidates websites</a>. Good to see more people taking interest in suck a narrow topic. I agree on some points and disagree on others. The fact that he does not like McCains site makes me sad.
