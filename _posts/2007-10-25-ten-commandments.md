Okay.. in a post Passion of the Christ world a movie on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/thetencommandments/trailer/">Ten Commandments</a> will make tons of money. But this has to be the worst looking animated movie in almost 20 years. Who let this horrid movie in to production?
