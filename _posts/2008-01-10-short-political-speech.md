This is not a political blog and while I have not avoided linking to political issues I'm kind of avoided talking about too much politics. More and more though I really just want this site to be a direct reflection of myself. Mostly I do that by highlighting the best of what I am reading or watching. While I don't want this whole "reflection" thing to spiral to me talking about daily minutia I think politics are important enough to warrant voicing my opinion.

It would be fair to say last presidential election cycle was disappointing and I'm hoping this one will do better.  And so far it is. In the begging I have to say I was most excited about Biden and Richarson. Biden has already dropped out and Richardson has turned out to not speak well on a national level.

I was not a big fan of Obama, Clinton, or Edwards in the beginning. If you don't research and just go by sound bites they all kind of sound the same and being the front runners I did not have much hope for them. On closer inspection recently I have come around and now I can Say I would be happy for any of them to be president and actually kind of excited about Obama.

I've seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4yVlPqeZwo">Obama talk about technology at google</a> and <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/2007/11/4barack.html">Lawence Lessig's support</a> really sold me. I've also read enough about what Hillary wanted to do with our health care and how she was deionized for it to really believe she has a strong hold on what is wrong in America. And while Obama seems to be good at giving really inspiring speeches I think Hillary could do a lot to humanize this country if she did not fall in to the trap of acting too macho.

The media seemed determined to pick a president already but I think it's going to be a long race between the top three democrats. It does not seem to be projected but I certainly think it would be good for America if Edwards won in the Carolinas and made the race even tighter. Who ever does win I have hard time believing we could not all agree they are better then any one the republicans have.

On the other side Ron Paul is funny cause 90% of the time he talks about stuff that every one seems to agree upon. But he has <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/theluddite/2008/01/luddite_0110?currentPage=1">a lot of opinions are so extreme that don't seem to make as much sense</a>. I agree that the education department is not doing a good job but I don't believe getting rid of it will fix the problem.

McCain is some one I used to like a lot but now I don't know what to think. He seems to have supported bush more these past years then he had in the past. I mean he's better then Huckabee I guess who may very well be even worse then Bush.
