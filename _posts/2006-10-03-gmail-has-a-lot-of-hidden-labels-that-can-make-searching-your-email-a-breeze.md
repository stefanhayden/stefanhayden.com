<p><a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/10/hidden-labels-in-gmail.html">Gmail has a lot of hidden labels</a> that can make searching your email a breeze. I can't remember them on top of the fact that they are clunky to type. Gmail really needs to find a better interface to let me quickly access these features.
