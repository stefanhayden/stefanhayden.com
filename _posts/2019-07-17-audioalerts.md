I'm launching a new site called [AudioAlerts.io](https://audioalerts.io)! It's a live dashboard that can play a sound when your users take action on your site. I've been working on it for a few months now and we have [a post up on producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/audioalerts-io) that you can vote for! Intsall the [Audio Alerts npm client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audioalerts) and trigger the code from the client or the server!

This is my first big site launch. I built it all in firebase for both the live updates and the static file hosting and it has full integration with stripe for the subscriptions. I'm very excited for people to try it and to keep building out new features.
