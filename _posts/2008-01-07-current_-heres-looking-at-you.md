<a href="http://current.com/items/88806126_here_s_looking_at_you">This is a really great project where two talking heads describe each other</a>. It's amazing how much you learn about a person just from hearing them talk about other people's appearance. It's only 7 minutes long but I almost feel this could be made to go on to a long time before I get bored of it. (via everyone seems to be linking this)
