<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/21/legend-of-korra-the-creators-of-avatar-the-last-airbender-on-the-new-spinoff/">Read it here</a>. I'm so excited for them. It's funny that basically anything they could have said would have come across as an insult to M. Night Shyamalan.

<blockquote>
<strong>What did you guys think of the live-action version of “The Last Airbender”?</strong>
<br /><br />
<strong>Konietzko:</strong> We’re just really focused on this new show right now, and kind of taking this off in its own direction and not concerning ourselves with that right now.
<br /><br />
<strong>So you didn’t follow the casting controversy about the movie version of “The Last Airbender”?</strong>
<br /><br />
<strong>Konietzko:</strong> We didn’t head up that film. We’re just happy to be back generating the original content in this mythology, which is what we do.
