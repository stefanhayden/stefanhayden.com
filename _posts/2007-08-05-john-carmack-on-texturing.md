<p>This is a really amazing video where John Carmack shows off their new development environment for artist. This new system lets artists add as many textures to a game as they want with out effecting performance. It sounds like this might even ship with the game? It sounds like designing for games is quickly leaving the realm of very specialized designers and is about to be more available to the public.</p>
