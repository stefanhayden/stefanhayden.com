I dislike him for slightly different reasons. But these are good reasons as well that I can get behind:

<blockquote style="font-size:17px; background:#51321D; padding:20px; margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;">I've never met [JJ Abrams]. I am not a member of his fan club or anti-fan club. I disliked Cloverfield a very great deal. I disliked Star Trek intensely. I thought it was terrible. And I think part of my problem is that I feel like the relationship between JJ Abrams' projects and geek culture is one of relatively unloving repackaging - sort of cynical. I taste contempt in the air. Now I'm not a child - I know that all big scifi projects are suffused with the contempt of big money for its own target audience. But there's something about [JJ's projects] that makes me particularly uncomfortable. As compared to somebody like Joss Whedon, who - even when there are misfires - I feel likes me and loves me and is on some cultural level my brother and comrade. And I don't feel that way about JJ Abrams. <br />-<a href="http://io9.com/5605836/china-mieville-explains-theology-magic-and-why-jj-abrams-hates-you">China Miéville</a></blockquote>
