<a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal 4.7</a> was just released. I've attempted to use it before and found it extremely complicated. There is no doubt that it's powerful though and lots of great community sites use it.

It's seems this release they have a done a lot to make it easier to use though I'll bet it still has a high learning curve. While they seem most proud of their new ajax goodness I'm interested in checking out their new php templating system.

I've gotten very used to the php templating on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and I'll be overjoyed if I can figure out how to design with drupal.

Interested? Check out this great screencast of <a href="http://drupal.org/videocasts/whats-new-in-4.7">what's new</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/videocasts/installing-4.7">how to install</a>.
