Cake was awesome last night. John McCrea said he was sick and could only play certain songs. Those songs seemed to be Cake's greatest hits though so I was more than happy. I'm still looking for a set list (<a href="http://www.swordplay.tv/2007/12/11/cake-set-list-dec-10-2007/">here's one from the 10th</a> and it even has Sad Songs and Waltzes!).

Seems like Some one filmed almost the entire show: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aNGW9P4s1s">Stickshifts &amp; Safetybelts</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YetYi7nwpYs">Opera Singer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY3UaHfa-P8">Never There</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR_0Lx_9eqU">Rock'n'Roll Lifestyle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK755W6sTg8">Wheels</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHW-CiuEdBc">Black Sabbath's War Pigs</a>

The same girl took some amazing photos as well. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tixgirl/sets/72157603444061870/">Here's the whole photo set on Flickr</a>.

Somehow I managed only to see the crappy openers King City and Brazilian Girls and Miss the two I was looking forward to seeing <a href="http://www.myspace.com/oakleyhall">Oakley Hall</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/agentribbons">Agent Ribbons</a>.
