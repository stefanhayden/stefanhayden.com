I only wish these inter-industry criticisms that game designer blogs and conferences would break out to be more mainstream:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.designer-notes.com/?p=195">When you have games industry professionals from large companies arguing that we shouldn’t worry about making a game less enjoyable as long as it generates more revenue – to me that is something to be concerned about.</a></blockquote>
