I have to be on my sixth or seventh time listening to <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/06/cory-drm-talk">Jason Kottke’s reading</a> of <a href="http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt">Cory Doctorow's DRM talk to Microsoft</a> for a flash animation I’m working on. I’ve read it though a few times as well and I really feel I get a better sense of the talk hearing it aloud. 

I’ve had a special place in my heart for the reading of texts ever since my family took long trips to Ohio from New Jersey and we listed to books on tape. We were early adopters of books on tape as a way to make all the kids get along and it worked so well that we never turned back.

Listing to Kottke’s reading really makes me long to hear Cory Doctorow give the talk. While Kottke’s reading does a good job of injecting some personality in to the text I really want to hear Cory read it with the passion that I’m sure he would bring to the reading.
