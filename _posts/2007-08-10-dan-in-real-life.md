Will <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/daninreallife/">Dan In Real Life</a> be a good movie or a bad one? Hard to tell. Steve Carell is in it but so Dane Cook. Though Steve's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/">last movie</a> was bad. So if this movie is bad then this makes it a trend and a downward one at that.
