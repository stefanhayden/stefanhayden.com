<p><a href="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptina has added AIR to it's plugins</a>. AIR has a huge amount of buzz around it and I honestly am not 100% sure what it can do. <a href="http://www.aptana.tv/movies/aptana_air/aptana_air.html">Aptina has a great screen cast to not only install the plugin but get started on AIR.</a>
