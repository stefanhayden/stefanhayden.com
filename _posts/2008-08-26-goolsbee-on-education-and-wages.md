<blockquote>Goolsbee pauses, then says: "That's why the last eight years' degradation of the budgets for science and its general politicization are so upsetting. The government's commitment to investment in advanced training of our own people has plummeted, so now something like two-thirds of those gaining science and engineering PhDs here aren't U.S. citizens. For many years America led globally in the percentage of 25-year-olds with college degrees. Now the U.S. is 31 in the world--right behind Bulgaria and right above Costa Rica. The problem for countries with skill levels between Bulgaria and Costa Rica is that 20 years from now they'll also have income levels between those countries."</blockquote>
