<p>Kathy Sierra, one of the best technology speakers alive today, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">has been receiving death threats</a> and has canceled all of her public appearances. This is not just an assault on Kathy but the entire tech community. I only wish we could do more for her.
