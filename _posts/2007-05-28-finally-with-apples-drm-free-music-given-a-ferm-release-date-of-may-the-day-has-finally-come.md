<p>Finally! With Apples DRM-Free music given a ferm release date of 'may' the day has finally come! <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/05/27/emis-drm-free-catalog-may-arrive-this-week-on-itunes">Ars Technica announces that iTunes should have it's music up tomorrow, May 29th</a>. I'm suddenly going to be very aware which of my favorite artists are signed to EMI and which are not.
