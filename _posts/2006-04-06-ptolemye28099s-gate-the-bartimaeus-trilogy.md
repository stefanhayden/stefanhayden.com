Finished the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0786818611/stefanhayden-20">last book of the Bartimaeus Trilogy</a> today. I'm a horrible book reviewer but I liked them a lot. The last one really seemed to stick out as exceptionally good. The last page really seemed to cut to black a bit quicker then you might like. Fantasy books tend to have epilogues and long drawn out endings but this one just stopped. It was sad but nice for a change.

Now that I've read all three I felt safe to roam the web looking for any additional info that might be out in the wild. Wikipedia has a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartimaeus_Trilogy">collection of articles about the series, books, and characters</a>. In general the book has enough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperstition#Hyperstition_and_theory">mythos</a> to build on and so a community coming together to put this together isn't that surprising.

Finally I made it over to <a href="http://www.bartimaeustrilogy.com/home.html">the official web site</a>. My goodness that is the ugliest web site that I've seen that wasn't <a href="http://www.camden.k12.nj.us/S/CHS/chs.htm">made for a high school</a>. If I was the book publisher I would be embarrassed to have a website so incredibly horrible. It's not even good for an old website, like early 90s, and these are very recent books abd YA books at that! And last I heard young adults are using the internet.
