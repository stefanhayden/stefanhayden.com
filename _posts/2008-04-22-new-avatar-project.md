<a href="http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=23222">Great interview over at toonzone with Bryan Konietzko and Mike DiMartino</a>. Although they says they are extremely involved in the Avatar movie I still have my doubts... esp about live action. But they also announced the possibility of a new Avatar Project:
<blockquote>TZN: Can you say if [the new project is] Avatar-related, or is it something new?

DIMARTINO: Yeah. It's a new incarnation of the Avatar story.</blockquote>
Hopefully this will be all new story and just not a retelling of Avatar in some other format. This is such good news after hearing the show was ending.
