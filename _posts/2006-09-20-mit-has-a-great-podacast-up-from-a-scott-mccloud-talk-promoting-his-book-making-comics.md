<p>MIT has a great podacast up from a <a href="http://cms.mit.edu/news/2006/09/colloquium_making_comics_by_sc_1.php">Scott McCloud talk</a> promoting his book Making Comics. Coming in at a hefty 2h and 16mins (just my style) the presentation does loose a lot with out the slides but there is still plenty of info to gleam. I'm so sad I missed this presentation!
