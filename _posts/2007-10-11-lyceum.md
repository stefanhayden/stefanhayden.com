In the past I have tried to install <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">Wordpress MU</a> with little success. <a href="http://lyceum.ibiblio.org/">Lyceum</a> is a separate branch of wordpress that also has multi-blog functionality. In a lot of ways it seems to be <a href="http://lyceum.ibiblio.org/faq/">a better setup then wordpress mu</a> as well.
