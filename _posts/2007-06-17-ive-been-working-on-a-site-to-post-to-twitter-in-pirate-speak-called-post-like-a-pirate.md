<p>I've been working on a site to post to Twitter in pirate speak called <a href="http://postlikeapirate.com/">Post Like A Pirate</a>. There are still lots of bugs to work out but I would love for people to try it out and help me find all the bugs. The email feature is currently the buggiest so treat it nicely. Any help improving the translator would also be greatly appreciated.
