<p>John Stewart will continue to deny it but <a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/cat_index_31.asp">this study say The Daily Show covers as much news as other news programs</a>. While The Daily Show adds comedy with their news, other news programs add "fluff like polls, political endorsements and photo opportunities".
