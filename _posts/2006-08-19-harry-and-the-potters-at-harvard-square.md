<p>I went to the <a href="http://www.eskimolabs.com/hp/">Harry and the Potters</a> show looking forward to seeing the opener <a href="http://www.evilwizardrock.com/">Draco and the Malfoys</a>. If you listed to CDs from both bands Draco clearly stand out as a better band. They have song that are about the Harry Potter books while Harry and the Potters often sound like they are just reading out of the books.</p>

<p>Draco and the Malfoys were great. With just 2 guitars they played the drum track off their laptop but that did not stop them from having a great energy.</p>

<p>I was blown away by Harry and the Potters. While they don't sound that great on a CD they are amazing live. Their songs are great for singing along to and the audience was on their feet jumping around for the whole set. I can't really explain the energy they had so instead take a look at the video.</p>

<p>If you ever get the chance and you have any interest in Harry Potter I greatly recommend stopping by a show.</p>
