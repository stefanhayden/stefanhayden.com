I've been ignoring <a href="http://openid.net/">openid</a> for a while. For no good reason really. Yesterday <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/">I turned my site in to my own openid</a>. With just a little html I can now use my url to log in to <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/directory">any openid website</a>. everyone should do this.
