<p>When did you do your first google search? I wish I knew. As the internet gets older we're going to look back on it more. Since I send such a crazy amount of time online I look back and try and see where I fit in the history of the web. This great post at Wisdump about the <a href="http://wisdump.com/web/the-ebb-and-flow-of-social-networking/">The Ebb and Flow of Social Networking</a> really got me thinking about where I fit in the flow.</p>
<p>I had fun going back and seeing when I joined different services that are significant on the web.</p>
