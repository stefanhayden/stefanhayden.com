If you ever liked Degrassi you have to start watching <a href="http://abcfamily.go.com/abcfamily/path/section_Shows+Secret-Life-Of-The-American-Teenager/page_Detail">The Secret Life of the American Teenager</a>. It might even be better the early Degrassi The Next generation. Only one episode is out and there is plenty of way for the show to mess up but is seems pretty solid so far.
