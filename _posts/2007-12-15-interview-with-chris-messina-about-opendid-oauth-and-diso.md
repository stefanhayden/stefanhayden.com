<span class="fn"><a href="http://brianoberkirch.com">Brian Oberkirch</a> (always a great interviewer) has an <a href="http://brianoberkirch.com/downloads/Chris%20Messina%20on%20DiSo.mp3">amazing interview with Chris Messina about OpendID, OAuth and Diso</a>. Only recently I fully comprehended OpenID (a great wordpress plugin here) and OAuth is slowly making it self clear to me.</span>

While a lot of these concepts are hard for me to absorb while just reading the specs once more down to earth tutorials and podcasts are out I'll be quick to try and implement some of these functionality.
