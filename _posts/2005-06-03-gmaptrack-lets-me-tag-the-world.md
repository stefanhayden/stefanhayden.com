While <a href="http://www.gmaptrack.com/">gMapTrack</a> still seems kinda of buggy it really looks like it will be as full featured as I had <a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/2005/04/09/my-google/">mentioned previously</a>. I really wish google has taken the initiative and added this functionality themselves. It would have blended in nicely with their <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/">Google Account</a> system they have going. I'm extra interested in this technology because, as of now, <a href="http://maps.google.com">google maps</a> does not list my house on their maps and for the google fanatic I am it's a little embarrassing. 

gMapTrack seems to still be rolling out alot of features (they say this coming Monday) and so I'll restrain from giving it a review using <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hReview">hReview</a> that's I've been itching to use. I'm looking forward to tagging the world. I would love this to integrate with <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCard">hCard</a> (my current obsession) and let me up load my contacts and then view their location on the map.
