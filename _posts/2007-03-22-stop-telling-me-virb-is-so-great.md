<p>If you sat <a href="http://www.virb.com">Virb</a> and Myspace together Virb wins. But if Myspace owns the world and Virb is simply a "<a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2007/03/virb-vs-myspace">feature-for-feature</a>" copy of Myspace then NO ONE CARES. </p>
<p>I like good design too but unless you have some functionality that is awesome that you can't live with out it then go home, or at least stop trying to be a Myspace killer.
