Just to stir up some trouble I thought I'd point out some of the more amusing points of SXSW.

<a title="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/" href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/"> Jason Santa Maria</a> really has a love hate relationship with Stan. Holistic Web Design used some illustrations of stan as users point of view and you could almost see Jason cringe.

<a title="http://www.shauninman.com/plete/" href="http://www.shauninman.com/plete/"> Sean Inman</a> is a tiny tiny man. He's extremely slight and most likely wears his facial hair proudly as to not be mistaken for a high schooler or perhaps a small child.
<a title="http://www.kottke.org/" href="http://www.kottke.org/">
Jason Kottke</a> is always hard to spot at conferences but that's only because no one's looking in the right places. If you are in a panel look to the far back corner to find the man who hides so well.

This year Jason offers other advice like "Never Get Married". Something he should say as much as he can if he really wants his wedding to go well in the next 2 weeks. All I can say is if I donated to Kottke.org do I get a wedding invitation? I think so.

<a title="http://www.erisfree.com/" href="http://www.erisfree.com/"> Eris Stassi</a> must be web designs little secrete. Her occasional posts on her blog were very reflective and deep though very far between. Clearly she has a lot of clout as she really directed the Holistic Web Design panel in there decisions and really seemed to be a diving force in how amazing the redesign of Plazes seemed to be. Not to mention that she is <a title="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=bio&id=99755" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=bio&id=99755">truly beautiful</a>.

Perhaps it's good that the web design bolgosphere only cares about content and could care less if your pretty or not. Though it seems most big named designers are not ugly at all. I mean look how pretty Jason Santa Maria is. Talk about one sexy beast.
