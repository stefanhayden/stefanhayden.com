I have this thing I do where I look down at people who can't handle their umbrella. It's not that hard to not have it turn inside out. You just point it in to the wind. Come on people!

Today the wind got a little... well lets not make excuses but my umbrella tuned inside out and I broke a streak of that not happening that is I don't know how old. OLD.

Speaking of streaks people keep track of I have not thrown up in forever either. And haven't really cried since I saw the last episode of Six Feet Under back in... 2007? I know most people don't see that as an accomplishment but it's still something to be noted.

The internet is <a href="http://maureenjohnson.blogspot.com/2009/03/blog-every-day-april.html">alive with blogging</a> and I currently feel a little left out.
