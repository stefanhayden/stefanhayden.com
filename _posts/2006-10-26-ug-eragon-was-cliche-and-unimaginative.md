<p>Ug. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0375826688/stefanhayden-20">Eragon</a> was cliché and unimaginative. I can't believe it gets so much praise. I would not recommend this book to anyone who reads a lot of fantasy. I've such a long list of problems with the book it's not even worth going in to.
