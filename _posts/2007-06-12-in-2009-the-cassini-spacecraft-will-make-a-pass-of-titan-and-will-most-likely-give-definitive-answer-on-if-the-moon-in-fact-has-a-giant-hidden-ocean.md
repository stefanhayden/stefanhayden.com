<p><a href="http://space.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn12041&feedId=online-news_rss20">In 2009 the Cassini spacecraft will make a pass of Titan and will most likely give definitive answer on if the moon in fact has a giant hidden ocean</a>. If one found I have a feel NASA will finally feel confident enough to fast track a mission to land something on Titan. Titan is quickly becoming one of the most interesting objects in space.
