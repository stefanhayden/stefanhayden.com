<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLw5wNt7GdE">I made this</a> about a week ago and forgot to post it here. I would say most who read this blog know who I am but I'm sure there are a few who do not. The site I mention that I made is <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com">Books I Am Reading</a> where <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com/stefanhayden">I keep track of all of my books</a>.
