It took me a second to get over the shock but <a href="http://www.amazon.com">the new Amazon redesign</a> is really awesome. It really feel like they hidden a lot of interface away and really let users discover features as they need them. hiding interface elements can be one of the hardest things to convince some one to do but it always seems to pay off. I'm glad to see Amazon agrees.
