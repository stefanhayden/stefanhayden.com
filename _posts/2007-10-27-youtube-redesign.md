<a href="http://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=qbnbG2JO05Q">YouTube is starting a major redesign</a> and have made some odd and interesting choices. Amazon recently impressed me by hiding away alot of interface to fit more contest on the screen. YouTube seems headed in a similar direction.

Their new layout definitely looks better then the old one but they have made a choice that does not sit as well with me. In hiding away all those interface elements in dropdown menus they have taken all that new space and put a 300x250 add on the page in place of the 160x600 ad.

Perhaps it's not glaringly obvious to most people but I can't look at that page with out imagining a designer told to redo the page so a 300 ad could fit on it.  Design that purely motivated by ad placement always make me queasy.
