<a href="http://marvel.com/digitalcomics">Marvel puts 2,500 comics online behind a pay wall for $60 a year</a>. This is almost worth it to me as I've not been following comics for a while now and I'm sure there are tons of stuff on there  I would love to read. If they added the new comics every month I would pay as high as $120 a year for access to that service.
