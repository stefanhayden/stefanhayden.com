I wanted to watch <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003200.shtml">The Battle Over Books</a> at the New York Public Library. I was sad when I forgot about it and missed it but have been eagerly awaiting the video which has been slow to show up.

The <a href="http://smartleydunn.com/wired/wiredbattle.mp3">audio is up</a> now though certain parts of it are a little jumpy. From my point of veiw the The Authors Guild seems to just be saying the same thing over an over again. Being the geek I am I will most likely watch the video once that come out as well.
