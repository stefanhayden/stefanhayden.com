This is the kind of news I expect to see a lot of from Obama: <a href="http://bnonews.com/elections/?id=186">Obama Transition Co-Chair John Podesta announced the strictest, and most far reaching ethics rules of any transition team in history</a>. And by expect I mean I'll be pissed off if I don't see it. I want to make history, I want to reform goverment, I want to get it done.
