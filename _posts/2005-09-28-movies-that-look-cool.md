I was bored and was playing around on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">apple movie trailers site</a>. This is what I've come up with that I want to see. 

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/bee_season/">Bee Season</a> - November 11th</li>
After Spellbound Spelling Bee movies hold a special spot in my heart even though I never could spell.
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/capote.html">Capote</a> - <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/capote/">apparently already out but got good reviews.</a></li>
Looks interesting though I not surprised I missed it since I have not ben paying attention.
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/shopgirl/">Shopgirl</a> - October 28th</li>
Acually saw this preview in the theater and looks good.
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/akeelahandthebee.html">Akeelah And The Bee</a> - 2006</li>
There are alot of these Spelling Bee movies out. This one looks cute. 
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/the_warrior.html">The Warrior</a> - July 15th</li>
A british film about the middle east. Looks great though I doubt Keri would want to see it.
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/junebug.html">Junebug</a> - <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/junebug/">apparently already out but got good reviews.</a></li>
This film looks awesome. There is a great quote about how it "distills antagonistic red-state, blue-state attitudes." I definetly want to see this one.
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/roryosheawashere.html">Rory Oâ€™Shea Was Here</a> - February 4th, 2005?</li>
That came out a long time ago. Why is it still on the trailer site? Looks kinda cool as well.
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/saving_face.html">Saving Face</a> - May 27th, 2005?</li>
May wasn't that long ago but even still. There was <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/mysummeroflove.html">another film about lesbianism</a> but it looksed kinda creepy. This one looks awsome and I totaly want to see it.
