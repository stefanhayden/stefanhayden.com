Excited to have <a href="https://www.twitter.com/David_Ingram">@David_Ingram</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/NBCNews">@NBCNews</a> dive deeper in to what happened at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Shutterstock">@Shutterstock</a> when it decided to ban search terms in china. Employees and media need to work together to hold companies to account.

And I also want to make a reminder that I care a lot about Shutterstock and my fellow employees. I don't want to have a controversy to talk about. I just want to build websites with my friends. 9+ years I was able to do that. I wish everything had been different.
