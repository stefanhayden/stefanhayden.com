<a href="http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=blog&amp;id=8540">HBO has commissioned a pilot of George R.R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire series</a>. Because it's HBO I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Unlike the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Seeker">Legend of the Seeker</a> which I assumed would be horrible and have yet to force myself to watch on TiVo. <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com/stefanhayden/book/a-game-of-thrones-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-book-1">I've been wanting to read this series for a while</a> and I think I'll actually need to do it before this happens.
