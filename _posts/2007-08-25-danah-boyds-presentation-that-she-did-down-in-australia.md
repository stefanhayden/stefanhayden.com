Finally got a chance to watch <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/08/22/australian_educ.html">danah boyd's presentation that she did down in Australia</a>. I've read her site for a while but really learned alot of stuff about the education system. Some of which I knew and some of which I didn't but all of it framed in a way I had not thought about it. Definitely worth a watch if you interested in the direction America's youth is moving.
