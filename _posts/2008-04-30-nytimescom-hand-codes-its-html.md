<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/04/30/nytimescom-handcodes.html">NYTimes.com hand-codes its HTML</a>. Why in the world is this so news worthy? I hear the Times also pays writers for stories and the sky is blue. 

My best guess is that this might be the crossover moment for non web organizations. To date when most people think of web designers they think of dreamweaver. Perhaps now companies will start demanding hand coding designers. But who knows.
