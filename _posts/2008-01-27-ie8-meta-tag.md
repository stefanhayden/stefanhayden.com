I think what's so confusing about this IE8 meta tag is that people are trying to explain it like it makes sense (since <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/beyonddoctype">ALA</a> likes it) and it just does not make any sense at all. <a href="http://glyphobet.net/blog/?p=17">This is one of the few articles that makes really good sense</a>.
