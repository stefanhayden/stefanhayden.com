<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/">Apple will never stop astounding me</a>. The price of the iPhone drops $200 after 2 months. The people who were suckered in to buying are give half that ($100) in store credit. And people are so happy they can't believe it. If it were me I'd want my $200 back in real money and not Steve Jobs dollars.
