Everyone is pissed off at <a href="http://search.wikia.com/wiki/Search_Wikia">Wikia Search</a>. They said it is useless. In a way they are right but they are missing the point of this alpha release.

It's clear that feature is missing and content is nonexistent. But how comprehensive was wikipedia on day one? I can only assume it started with basically nothing.

Earlier today I was looking around for more info on Katy Perry. For some reason she seems to not be on wikipedia but on page two (of google) was <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Katy_Perry">Katy Perry's Mahalo page</a>. And there was ton of useful info.

Wikia Search is right on the heals of Mahalo and now that it's out in an Alpha test people can start updating the mini wiki articles for each search. Wikia is easier to edit them Mahalo and with a lot of use Wikia Search will be a great resource.
