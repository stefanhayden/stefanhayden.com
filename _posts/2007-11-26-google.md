Google tries to project the image that they live 100 years in the future when it comes to the work place. But it's kind of amusing that that for their google talks they often have the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLpxX9vqr5c">same author</a> give the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ReoXpKsOB0">same talk</a> at multiple locations. I can't see why they don't just pay the author once and teleconference the rest of the company in. How low tech of google.
