Not exactly a world breaking announcement but <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com/register">I've added normal Usernames and Passwords to Books I Am Reading</a>. My ability to make openID work correctly has been a bit of a joke. If your tired of messing with openID you can add an email and password in the <a href="http://www.booksiamreading.com/account">account section</a>.
