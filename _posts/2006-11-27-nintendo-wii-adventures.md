<p>The day it came out I got a <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/">Nintendo Wii</a> and have been greatly enjoying it. The motion sensor is very sensitive and you can get some great control out of it. The Wii Sports game that comes with the system is a great set of mini games that really gets everyone excited about the system. I brought it to work and Thanksgiving and it was a big hit every where even though I only own one controller.</p>
<p>I also went out and got a Gamecube controller and memory card so I could play <a href="http://www.zelda.com/gcn/">Zelda: The Windwaker</a>. It's a great game and works great on the Wii. I've also downloaded Mario 64 and used the Gamecube controller to play it and it plays great.</p>
<p>Over all it's been a very big video game week. I haven't played this many video games since before college.
