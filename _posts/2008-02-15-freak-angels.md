I'm actually really excited about the new online comic <a href="http://freakangels.com/">Freak Angels</a>. <a href="http://www.stefanhayden.com/blog/2008/02/02/state-of-the-comic-book-industry/">I've done a lot of thinking about how I want to read comics</a> and I think this maybe very much in line with how I would like to. Freak Angels is a free weekly comic that weighs in at around 6 pages each (only the first one is up).

The format is still pages for a print book so full graphic novels will most likely be printed.Â  I really would like a serial comic to come out like this that is more formated for the widescreen of computers.
