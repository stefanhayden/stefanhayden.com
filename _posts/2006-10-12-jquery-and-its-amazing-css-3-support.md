<p><a href="http://ejohn.org/">John Resig</a> stopped by <a href="http://www.refreshboston.org/">Refresh Boston</a> and gave a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> demo. It turns out its amazing but it has a flaw.</p>
<p>While it's super short and easy to use it also has full CSS 3 support which means <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/">any CSS selector on this list can be used</a>.</p>
<p>CSS 3 selectors? No browser even does that! I know I'm not supposed to use Javascript to style html elements but the draw of CSS 3 selectors is almost too strong to resist.</p>
<p>I only hope I'm strong enough to resist.
