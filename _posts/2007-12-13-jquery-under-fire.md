Crazy Javascript framework drama. Somebody over at <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/i-learned-some-things-about-jquery-today/">MooTools bashed jQuery with some pretty harsh claims</a>. John Resig understandably upset fired back. The head of <a href="http://blog.mootools.net/2007/12/13/an-open-apology-to-the-authors-of-jquery-prototype-and-others">MooTools replies that he has removed the presenter from the development team because of his immaturity</a>. Who thought that so much drama could happen over javascript frame works. I of course am a huge jQuery user.
