So I got in to <a href="http://beta.thewb.com">The WB site's beta</a> and thought I would just give a quick review. <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a> has set the bar pretty high and no one should be surprised that The WB does not measure up. The site is really dark and the design is a little wonky. The shows' flash player has a clunky MAC want to be interface and the video is really small.

But even with all of those problems they should have a chance as long as they put tons of video up. And I mean full seasons. Currently they just have a few random episodes of a few WB shows. I hope that's a result of it being a beta as with out entire seasons I can't imagine going back.

The do plan on adding some web only shows. I'm a sucker for good web content and so I do look forward to seeing how well they are made.

Over all disappointing and I doubt most will be fixed. But with enough content they should draw plenty of traffic. I know Keri really wants to watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everwood">Everwood</a>.
