<p><a href="http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press18.htm">EMI Music launches DRM-free on iTunes for $1.29</a>. The DRM-Free music also has higher sound quality but who cares. Really higher sound quality just means fews songs on an ipod. The music is still in AAC format. It's not hard to convert unprotected AAC to MP3 but really why should I have to bother? Overall a good start.
