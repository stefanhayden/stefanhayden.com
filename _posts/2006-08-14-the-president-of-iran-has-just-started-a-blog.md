<a href="http://www.ahmadinejad.ir/">The President of Iran has just started a blog</a>. I would love to read it to get a better understanding of the other side of the story. Some where some one will pick up the slack and translate The Iranian President's posts to English. Let me know if you find who is translating the posts.
