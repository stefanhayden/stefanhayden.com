Stefan Hayden has invited you to join thefacebook.com, where
you and Stefan can see each other's friends and many other members
of your college community.

within your college through courses, organizations, and friends.

Thefacebook is for people who want to see a universal facebook at
their college, and who want to share information with the rest of the
community.

Once you register for Thefacebook, you can browse through everyone's
profiles and even create your own if you'd like.
