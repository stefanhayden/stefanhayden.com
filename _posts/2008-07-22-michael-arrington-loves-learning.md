Michael Arrington Loves Learning things. After <a href="http://www.edgeio.com">learning he doesn't know anything about web services</a> he now want to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/we-want-a-dead-simple-web-tablet-help-us-build-it/">learn he doesn't know anything about hardware</a>. Next I think he will learn how not to run for public office.
