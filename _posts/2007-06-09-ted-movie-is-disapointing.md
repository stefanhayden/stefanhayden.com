<p><img src="http://cdn-4.nflximg.com/us/boxshots/large/70067274.jpg" alt="TED" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;" />I've always been a big fan of the <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks">TED</a> conference videos online. I'm a big fan of long interesting talks about seemingly dull subjects. Based on this I hoped the new TED movie <em><a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Future_We_Will_Create_Inside_the_World_of_TED/70067274?trkid=134852">The Future We Will Create: Inside the World of TED</a></em> would be just as good. Sadly it just comes off as a 73 minute advertisement for the conference. They would have been better off just highlighting some of the bes speeches. I was vary disappointed.
