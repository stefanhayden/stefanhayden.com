I really want to like <a href="http://www.sinsofasolarempire.com/">Sins of a Solar Empire</a> after playing the demo. it's an awesome game. I just really suck at RTS games and even lost on easy. If you like RTS definitely <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/sinsofasolarempire/download_6188180.html">check out the demo</a>.
