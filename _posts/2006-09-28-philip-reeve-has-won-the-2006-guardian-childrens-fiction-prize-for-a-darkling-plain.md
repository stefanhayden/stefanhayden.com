<p><a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/childrensfictionprize2006/story/0,,1883363,00.html">Philip Reeve has won the 2006 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize</a> for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0439949971/stefanhayden-20">A Darkling Plain</a>, the fourth and final volume of the Hungry City Chronicles. The Hungry City Chronicles remains to be the best set of books I've ever read.
