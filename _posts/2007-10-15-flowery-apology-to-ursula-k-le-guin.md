Cory Doctorow has a long <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/169826091/an-apology-to-ursula.html">flowery apology to Ursula K Le Guin</a> because she's a copyright nazi that seems to be trying to enforce laws that don't exist. What really seems to bother me is that if she was not a well known author Cory would not be sucking up to her. He would tell her he was within the law and to shove it. Cory just seem to be so crushed by his admiration for Ursula to put his foot down.
