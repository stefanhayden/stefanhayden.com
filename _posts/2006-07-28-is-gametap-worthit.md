It's all about the selection though. I don't know if I want it enough yet to pay for it just yet. One down side is that it does not seem they announce new games on the site. How will I know when that killer game I'm waiting for will finally show up? Here's a list of the game I think I would actually play if I got a subscription.

2020 Super Baseball
Baldur's Gate
Conquest: Frontier Wars
Heroes of Might and Magic 1,2,3,4
Homeworld 2
Kid Chameleon
Myst 1,3, Riven, Uru
Populous: The Beginning
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc
Sim City 2000 Special Edition
SimTower
All The Sonic Titles
The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions
The Oregon Trail
Tom Clancy
Tomb Raider
Tropico  1, 2
Wings of War
Worms (several different ones)
