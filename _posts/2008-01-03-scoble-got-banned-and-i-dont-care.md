Once the blogosphere hates you there is nothing you can do right. Robert Scoble was <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/03/ive-been-kicked-off-of-facebook/">tooling around on facebook</a> with a bot and got banned. <a href="http://www.markevanstech.com/">And some how this is facebook's mistake</a>?

Who cares who Scoble is and why do people think he's so important that he can break any rule that normal people can not. This is the same attitude that is in the white house and it's just insidious how people think that marking Scoble as an "important" member so he can break their TOS is a good idea.

You always hear about food critics sneaking in to restaurants to get the same service as everyone else. Where is that attitude on the net? Why should any one get special Treatment? This whole story pisses me off.
