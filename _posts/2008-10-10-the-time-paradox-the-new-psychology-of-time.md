It's been a while since there has been an amazing talk at google. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LDwdyIxRy0">This is one of them</a>.

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/1LDwdyIxRy0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/1LDwdyIxRy0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

This really explains personality types a lot. <a href="http://www.thetimeparadox.com/surveys/">You can take the test here</a>. Here are my results:

Past-negative	   2.70
Past-positive	   2.78
Present-hedonistic	   2.53
Present-fatalistic	   1.44
Future	   3.77

This is a graph with the 50% mark being "average" and the red dots being an "ideal time perspective" and the green being my scores. Clearly they think I should enjoy my past more (Past Positive) and live more in the moment (Present Hedonism). I'm mostly future oriented but you can tell I'm still below the "ideal". Which I think rings true since I am very good at thinking about the future but not as good as I wish I was at enacting the plans to get to that future. <a href="http://www.thetimeparadox.com/2008/08/an-overview-of-time-perspective-types/">Here's more info on the perspective types</a>.
