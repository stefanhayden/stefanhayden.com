<a href="http://dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/4/13/952/10706/140/486004">Are blogs and Wikipedia to blame for a diminished respect for facts and research</a>? It seems the news industry has been discrediting it self for years now with out the internet's help.
<blockquote>But the right wing talk brigade doesn't exist just to build up their own or tear down Democrats. They have, from the moment they first rolled onto the air, existed to tell you that <strong>traditional news organizations are no good</strong>.  The Washington Post?  Inside the beltway losers out of touch with real America.  CNN?  The Clinton News Network.  The New York Times?  Please.  Do you really have to ask?</blockquote>
