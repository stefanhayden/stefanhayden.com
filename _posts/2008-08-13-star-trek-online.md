Oh the early days of an MMO. So full of promise and hope. A time when <a href="http://www.bingegamer.net/index.php/2008/star-trek-online-details/">anything a developer says is a fact</a> about the game. Here are my favorites about Star Trek Online so far:

<blockquote>STO will not be a level-based MMO that will take hours upon hours of mindless, pointless grinding that would go against everything Star Trek stands for. </blockquote>

<blockquote>The game will be designed so that those of us with lives will be able to hold our own against those sad, sorry individuals who sink 60+ hours a week into their MMO.</blockquote>

I'm trying to remember an MMO that didn't promise both of those things. Come on people? Do we have to get so starry eyed every time?
