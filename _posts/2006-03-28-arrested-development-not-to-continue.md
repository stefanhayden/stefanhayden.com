The dream dies today as <a title="http://forum.dvdtalk.com/showthread.php?t=460418" href="http://forum.dvdtalk.com/showthread.php?t=460418">Arrested Development will stop pursuing a new network</a> to air on. I'm not exactly sure how many Showtime subscriptions it takes to pay for a show but something tells me they would have made their money back if they had actually picked up the show.
