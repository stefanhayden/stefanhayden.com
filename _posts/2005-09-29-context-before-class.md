<a href="http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/09/elements-of-xhtml/">Tantek has a great presentation up on Semantic XHTML</a>. To many designers, my self included, get lost in DIV soup when there are tons of usable tags that come with meaning already built in. If you know CSS and are looking for a way to hone that skill this is the presentation to look to.st

Some stuff like Semantic tables still really confuses me. I know I can get it if I try!
