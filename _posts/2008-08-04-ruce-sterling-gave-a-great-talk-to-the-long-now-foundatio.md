<a href="http://blog.longnow.org/2008/08/03/bruce-sterlings-sharp-warning-8-years-later/">Bruce Sterling gave a great talk to the Long Now Foundation</a> (back in 2000) on how to make their 10,000 year clock stand the test of time culturally. Some of my favorite ideas are making the clock radioactive and deadly or making it unreachable in the Marianas trench.
