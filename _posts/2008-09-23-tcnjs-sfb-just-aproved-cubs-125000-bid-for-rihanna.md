Holy Shit! <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/">TCNJ</a>'s <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~sfboard/">SFB</a> just aproved <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~CUB/">CUB</a>'s <a href="http://media.www.signal-online.net/media/storage/paper771/news/2008/09/24/News/Sfb-Funds.Cubs.Rihanna.Bid-3446750.shtml?reffeature=textemailedition">$125,000 bid for Rihanna</a>. I know they uped the Student Activies Fund but that's a lot of money. For reference four years ago <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~CUB/oneevent.php?single=CUB%20Dance%20Party%20Featuring%20Kevin%20Lyttle&amp;when=20041109">when I put on my concert for TCNJ it was around $40,000</a> which was big money in the day but too little to get an artist anyone wanted to see (I had Kevin Little (who? exactly.)).

Even back then there were talks about getting rid of the concert completly since we did not have the money to fund a real one. Clearly there is a new effort to get the job done and it looks like it will suceed.
