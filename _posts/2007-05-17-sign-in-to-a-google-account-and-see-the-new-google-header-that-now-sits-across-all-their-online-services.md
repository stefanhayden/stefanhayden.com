<p><a href="http://www.gmail.com">Sign in to a Google Account</a> and see the new Google header that now sits across all their online services. Besides looking different it also has a more link with a drop down menu of many other Google services. The only mistake is that I can't middle click the drop down list to open in a new tab instead of a new window.
