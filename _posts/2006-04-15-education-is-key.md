With web design so new there is a lot of talk about people coming to it as a second career. Many <a href="http://simplebits.com/">with out any design training at all</a>. This of course has advantages and disadvantages, letting you come at web design with a fresh perspective but lacking the technical knowledge to back it up (though <a href="http://simplebits.com/">Dan</a> Seems to do okay). Others, like <a href="http://patrickhaney.com/">Patrick</a> and myself, are young, out of design school, and have wanted to work in the web as a first career choice.

Recently at SXSW <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060026">Mark Bolton and others</a> had a panel about design and art direction on the web and how it is really lacking. In my mind this has to be partially be because of the lack of people who understand design at a very high level.

It's my hope that in the future, as the web matures, that more focus will be put on higher education and deep understanding of design principals. Education that doesn't stop at a BFA but continues to a MFA.

<a href="http://www.ambriente.com/blog/2006/04/considering_an.html"> Ricardo Miranda has a great introductory post</a> up about how to start thinking if an MFA is a good idea for you. If you're in design and never got a degree in it getting an MFA might be a good way solidify your foundation in design. And if you're like me and already have a BFA an MFA might be a great way to make those formal skills razor sharp.

I still hope to make it to an MFA one day and every good guide and how to I can find will only make my decision that much more informed.
