When it comes to Shutterstock there is more to the story then just censorship in china. 20% of the company pushed back and the only answer was "no". There was zero attempt to compromise.

<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/13/business/layoffs-underway-wayfair/">Wayfair employees walked out and got some amazing compromises</a>! they listened! This is good management!

Why would anyone want to work for a company that will not listen to their own employees?
