<a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentAlias=symbolsigns">AIGA has a great list of symbol signs</a> that are free for every one but I don't think most people take advantage of it. While a lifesaver for anyone making a map they are useful in other situations as well.

Working on a site that has to do with recycling I thought there was no better place to look for a quick dingbat then the symbol signs that AIGA provides. Much to my surprise they did not have the recycle sign. In fact while the list is a great resource there seems to be a lot of useful symbols not available such as the biohazard, the nuclear, and handicapped symbols.

In an effort to help other designers not have to spend time designing little dingbat here is my list of useful dingbats:
