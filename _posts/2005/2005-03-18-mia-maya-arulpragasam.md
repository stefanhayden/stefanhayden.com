<img src="/img/mia.jpg" alt="M.I.A. -- Maya Arulpragasam" style="margin-right:10px;" width="200" align="left"/>I think the best thing about the <a href="http://www.miauk.com/">M.I.A.</a> buzz is this <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/40374">MeFi thread</a> where she has lit a great flame war between the ones that love it and hate it. A mix somewhere between hip-hop, electronica, Nintendo cartridges, and reggae a lot of people feel it’s supposed to be retro while others, including my self, really see it as an ultra-current hip hop type music. Another interesting argument is if the group her father was involved in actually was a terrorist group. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Eelam">Tamil Tigers</a> have also been called freedom fighters for a part of northeast Sri Lanka. I can’t say with much authority which is closer to the truth but <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/interviews/m/mia-05/">through interviews</a> Maya seems like a really cool girl with a really unique perspective on the world. I’ve been wanting to try and get my self in to more music from south Asia ever since the wonderful <a href="http://www.trenton.edu/~artmain/faculty/hutton.php">Deborah Hutton</a> showed me the magic of the sub-continent.

You can see the <a href="http://www.smugglersite.com.nyud.net:8090/mov/fleischer_galang.mov">Galang video here,</a> it's Quicktime, and <a href="http://www.miauk.com/">her website</a> has a version of sunshowers in Real Player format.
