<img src='/blog/wp-content/aiga_design_conference_2005.gif' alt='aiga_design_conference_2005.gif' class="alignleft"/>I looks like AIGA has posted a lot of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aiga/tags/aigadc2005/">their own pictures to Flickr</a> and they photographed every volunteer but me! Guess that's what I get for lurking in the dark dark back stage and spending most of the rest of the time practically running getting stuff for back stage. All well.
