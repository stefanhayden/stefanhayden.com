            If I was a calendar I would really really want to be released on
January 1st as it's when most calendars start. This might just be
wishful thinking on my part but It would be a great birthday <span id="misp_compose_2" class="hmd">present</span> for me. Though if google just wants to let me in to the beta that would also be a nice present.<br /><br /><tags>birthday, google calendar, calendar</tags><br />
