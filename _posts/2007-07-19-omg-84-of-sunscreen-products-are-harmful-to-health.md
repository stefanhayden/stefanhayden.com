<p>OMG - <a href="http://www.newstarget.com/021927.html">84% of sunscreen products are harmful to health</a>. "Sunscreen products are a hoax, (sic) and sunscreen's effect of blocking ultraviolet radiation (UV light), which generates the powerful anti-cancer nutrient Vitamin D in human skin." I love reports like this that really turn my world on it's head. (via <a href="http://widerangle.tumblr.com/">Wider Angle</a>)
