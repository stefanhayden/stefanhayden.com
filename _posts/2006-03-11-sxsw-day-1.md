The panel bright up many problems but didn't really offer anything close to an answer. <a title="Jason Santa Maria" href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/">JSM</a> seemed the closest to bring actual conversation to what seemed mostly like a doom and gloom panel about how design sucks on the internet. They kept saying the technology wasn't at a point where we can just forget about it. I don't know if they are waiting for technology to stop but I think a large part of web design will be new technologies and functionality that can be added to websites. If they are waiting for technology to get to a point where it gets out of the way of making a website I think they have a long wait. Technology will continue to change and challenge how websites are made. Design needs to learn how to exist in that or die trying.<a title="Super Speed" href="http://flickr.com/photos/andybudd/109253644/"><img align="left" title="How to be a superhero" alt="How to be a superhero" src="http://static.flickr.com/50/109253644_e4c624d3d6_m.jpg" /></a>

<a title="How to Be A Web Design Superhero" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060001" /><a title="How to Be A Web Design Superhero" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060001"> </a><a title="How to Be A Web Design Superhero" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060001">How to be a web design superhero</a> was mostly fluff and I'm not really sure who that was supposed to help. Perhaps people who want to design but have no idea how to start. Not the people who really seem to come to <span class="hm" id="misp_0_4">SXSW</span>. They did have the prettiest presentation I've ever seen with a really engaging panning and sliding around. I not sure if it was Keynote or not but it sure looked cool. I wonder if they had the rights to use those super hero images. They looked like <a title="Alex Ross" href="http://www.alexrossart.com/">Alex Ross</a> painting but it's been so long sine I've followed comics that I can't really be sure.

<a title="How to Be A Web Design Superhero" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060001" /><a title="Jason Fried" href="http://www.37signals.com/">Fried</a> and <a title="Coudal" href="http://www.coudal.com/"><span class="hm" id="misp_0_5">Coudal</span></a> did a great job of summarising the entire conference and were great over all. <span class="hm" id="misp_0_6">Couldal</span> is greatly suited to be a moderator and I wish he had even more involvement in the conference. <span class="hm" id="misp_0_7">AIGA's</span> presenter in Boston, John Hockenberry, was not amazing and I think <span class="hm" id="misp_0_8">Coudal</span> could have easily stepped in and taken over. He's just so personable. Fried pointed out to a yahoo employee that yahoo wastes a lot of money. Basically saying they suck and it got a big reaction from the crowd. 'm sure that will come up again and again around the web with funny headline everywhere.<a title="Jason Fried" href="http://www.37signals.com/">

<a title="How to Make $$ With Your Blog Design Skills" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060009">Making money with your blog design skills</a> was mostly rehashing old information. I was hoping to hear some information about blog design that was different then regular websites beyond that you had to know how to use the blog technology. Though the panel was lacking in new information they were all great. The moderator was interesting, knowable and great at controlling the time flow. The panelist were extremely personable and I want to go to subscribe to all of there blogs right now.<a title="How to Make $$ With Your Blog Design Skills" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060009">

<a title="Kathy Sierra" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=bio&id=103421">Kathy Sierra</a>'s <a title="How to Create Passionate Users" href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060014">Creating Passionate Users</a> has to be up for best presentation in the conference. I think she blew about 200 minds in the most informative presentation I've ever seen. I'll definitely be looking for the notes in the near future to bring back to <span class="hm" id="misp_0_11">Sconex</span>.
