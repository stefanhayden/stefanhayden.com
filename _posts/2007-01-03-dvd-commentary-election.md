<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B00001MXXJ/stefanhayden-20" style="float:right;"><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B00001MXXJ.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="Election Poster" style=" width:150px;" /><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0126886/">Election</a></a> is a wonderfully odd movie with <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000111/">Matthew Broderick</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000702/">Reese Witherspoon</a> and Directed by <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0668247/">Alexander Payne</a> who also directed such great movies as <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0375063/">Sideways</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0257360/">About Schmidt</a>.</p>
<p>This DVD Commentary is really about Alexander Payne's directing and writing and directing process. Alexander is extremely well spoken and does a good job of mixing his commentary with out completely blotting out the movie in the background. I had not seen the movie in a long time and the way Alexander's comments intermixed with the actual audio made it easy to remember what happened.</p>
<p>Very few commentaries are worth listening to but this is definitely worth it if you have any interest in either Election or how directors come to create their own voice.
